If a particular horse interests them, they should put that horse's name on the application. An USERL volunteer will contact them to discuss the horse and put them in contact with the foster home. Once the potential adopter, foster home and the appropriate USERL Regional Director and\/or Executive Director agree that the horse and adopter is a match, USERL will schedule a barn check.  An USERL volunteer will schedule a time to meet you at your barn. S\/he will be looking for safety (i.e. no barbed wire, no junk in the pastures), a clean, healthy environment and the condition and temperament of your other horses, if any.  Depending on how quickly you can get out to meet the equine and how quickly we can get a volunteer to do your barn check, typically the process takes one week to one month.\r\nComplete and return the USERL Preliminary Adoption Application.  We will then contact you directly if we have additional questions. \r\nIf the personal interview is satisfactory and if the USERL has a potentially suitable equine at the time, the USERL will schedule an appointment to check the potential adopter's facilities. In addition, the USERL will also conduct interviews of the references provided by the potential adopter on the Preliminary Adoption Application. \r\nUpon satisfactory completion of the above, USERL will schedule a working session with the potential equine to determine if this is a suitable match. \r\nUpon the completion of the session, it will be determined whether or not the equine and potential adopter are compatible. The USERL may at that time require additional sessions.  \r\nFacility requirement: The facility shall have at least a roof and three sides and be in good repair and free of standing water. The equine must be allowed a minimum of 4 hours of daily turn out in a suitable and safe fenced area.  Barbed wire is not accepted by the USERL. The USERL requests that the adopted equine be kept with a companion equine or other compatible large herd animal. \r\nWhen all requirements and preliminary adoption procedures have been satisfied, the USERL will require the following at the time of final adoption:\r\nCompletion of a permanent Adoption Contract detailing the care, which is required for the individual equines being adopted.    \r\nPayment in full of an adoption fee (non-refundable after 30 days), which is based upon each individual equine, and set by the USERL at its sole discretion. \r\nThe USERL reserves the right to conduct unscheduled follow-up on the Adopted Animal and the facility at the USERL's discretion. If either are found to be in unsatisfactory condition, attempts will be made to help the adopters remedy the situation.  If these attempts are unsuccessful, the USERL retains the right to repossess the adopted equine at any time.  The USERL may require the adopter to submit to them receipt of proof of required veterinary and farrier care and\/or an annual health statement from the adopter's veterinarian and farrier.","about":"Mission statement:\r\nThe United States Equine Rescue League (USERL) is a non-profit organization dedicated to the compassionate care of equines.

This will help the adoption counselors facilitate the matchmaking process.  Most adoptions take at least 45 minutes to one hour to complete.  The Adoption Center is a busy place, so please be patient and allow yourself enough time for our process.  THANK YOU!\r\n\r\nWhat we will need to know when you adopt a new companion:\r\n\r\nIf you own your home, please bring some item of verification (tax bill, water bill, or mortgage statement.)  Please also be sure to check your homeowner\u2019s insurance policy.  Some policies restrict coverage for certain dog breeds.\r\n\r\nIf you DO NOT own your place of residence, please be sure the property owner will consent to have a pet on his\/her property.  We will verify with landlords over the phone before sending a new companion home, so please have the appropriate name and phone number available.\r\n\r\nOther pets already living with you will need to be up-to-date on vaccination.  This is to decrease the risk of spreading infectious disease from one animal to another.\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand that your new companion will be a member of your family.  This can mean a \r\n10-15 year commitment from you!  Please bring along family members so we can make sure it will be a good match before you make a commitment.  Also, if adopting a second dog, please bring your current dog with you---we can let them spend some time together and give you some suggestions on surviving the adjustment period.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure you have considered the financial obligation involved in caring for a companion animal.  This includes routine veterinary and emergency care, in addition to food, supplies and training.  The adoption counselors can give you an idea of basic costs involved for each type of animal.\r\n\r\nMany animals adopted from shelters can require an immediate visit to the veterinarian.  Because of the volume of un-vaccinated animals entering a shelter\u2019s care, the risk of transmissible contagious diseases can be quite high.  Kennel cough in dogs, and upper respiratory infections in cats are the two most common diseases that your newly adopted companion may experience.  You must ask yourself if you have the financial means to care for your new friend, beyond the initial adoption costs.\r\n\r\nBEFORE YOU COMMIT!!!!!  Please be honest with yourself about the actual time you have to train, groom, and exercise the companion animal you have chosen.  Some things to consider: Do you work long or erratic hours?  Do you like outdoor activity?  Who will care for your pet while you travel?  Will your pet be the appropriate size when he or she is full grown?  When adopting into a home with children:  Are you adopting to teach your child responsibility, or are your adopting because you have a responsible child?  Are your children comfortable around the animal you\u2019ve chosen?  Will YOU still remain committed to this animal when the children lose interest?  Take the time now to consider these things and find the best match for your lifestyle!\r\n\r\nWe thank your for offering your home to a \u201cpre-loved\u201d companion.  We hope he or she will be a wonderful addition to your family and your home!\r\n","about":"The Thomas J. O'Connor Animal Control and Adoption Center provides comprehensive animal control services and programs to our communities for the protection of animals, public health and safety, and the environment. \r\n\r\nThe Thomas J.

Our center has a full-service adoption service, a service rarely offered through municipal animal control programs. TJO has an in-house veterinarian two days per week, responsible for shelter animal wellness and sterilization surgery. Adoptable animals are spayed or neutered, vaccinated and screened for other health concerns.  Each animal is then placed into the adoption area to await a new home. Every animal is microchipped at the time of adoption.","meetPets":"Monday-Friday 12:00-4:30\r\nSaturday 12:00-4:00\r\nClosed Sundays and holidays","services":"Adoptions","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

This does not obligate you to adopt. You can either submit an online application or you can e-mail and request one. Please make sure you fill in the application completely. We are unable to process incomplete applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter you submit your application please allow 2-3 days for a volunteer to review your application. During this time your vet reference will be checked and a volunteer with determine if it is the best match for you and the animal. Applications are not approved on a first come, first serve basis. We match up the best home for the animal, so even if the pet has other applications, this does not meet he\/she will be adopted to that home. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon approval of your application a volunteer with contact you to set up a time for you to meet the animal or animals your interested in, if you are a local adopter. Pets are shown on an appointment basis. Our animals are kept in a foster type situation and not in a shelter. Since these are private homes, this makes it easier on everyone. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do a lot of out of state adoptions, please refer to the information below if you are out of state and will need shipping info.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdoption Fees\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEach dog or puppy in our care has an adoption fee. This can range between $50 and $200, but varies from pet to pet. It includes, but is not limited to the following.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***Basic vaccinations: Adult 8 in 1 Booster for dogs that come in at 6 months of age or older. Age appropriate puppy shots while in our care.,\r\n\r\n***De-worming of your new dog or puppies (this is given several times) \r\n\r\n***Heartworm test if the dog is of age. \r\n\r\n***Frontline or Adams for flea and tick treatment and prevention. \r\n\r\n***Heart guard for Heart worm prevention during the entire time the animal is at our facility. (age appropriate) \r\n\r\n***Spaying or Neutering of the dog if the puppy\/dog is old enough to be altered before leaving (over 6 months). Every animal we adopt out MUST be altered and you must sign a contract to this effect.\r\n\r\n***State required rabies vaccination administered by our veterinarian. (Age appropriate)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA lot of times our adoption fees do not even begin to cover what we put into the care and vet work of each animal. We are a privately run rescue and do everything out of pocket. This includes food, medical and basic day to day care of these animals. Thanks for wanting to save a life!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOut of State Adoptions and Shipping Info\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you are out of state and have found a puppy or dog you know you would love to bring home. We use Delta Pets First to fly our new puppies home. Sometimes when no Delta Flights are available, we fly American. We do all the flight scheduling and make all arrangements. We ask that you give us the times\/days you can generally pick up on and a list of local airport. Weekends are hard to book, but can be possible. We do not drug our puppies for the trip and have never had a problem with one of them not arriving safely. (although sometimes they do arrive a little messy) We recommend bringing a towel with you when you pick them up. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTravel Expenses\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe charge 50.00 for taking your new pet to the airport, and for the time we spend buying the crate, bedding, food and water dish, and preparing your pet for travel. We also have to take your dog or cat to the veterinarian for an additional vet check, to get a health certificate, which is required by all airlines. Each of us are volunteers and we charge this additional fee to help recoup some of our expenses for gas and travel time (the airport is about one hour each way) and we generally spend an hour on each puppy\/dog going out there. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCrate for Shipping\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour new puppy\/dog will need an airline safe crate for travel. The cost of the crate depends on what size he\/she requires. \r\n\r\nSmall Crate - $45 \r\n\r\nMedium Crate - $65 \r\n\r\nLarge Crate - $85 \r\n\r\nWe line the bottom of the crate with blankets or towels for comfort and in case there is an accident and we provide a safe toy for the trip to make it easier (unless two puppies are flying together). This crate is yours to keep\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth Certificate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour new friend will require a Health Certificate for travel. He\/she will be taken to our Vet and given an exam. He generally checks the dog\/puppy over and looks at eyes, ears, and hips. He listens to their heart and lungs. This is just part of the exam. The cost for this is $50. You will receive the health certificate with your new puppy\/dog and it will have the vet's info who completed the exam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShipping Costs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are responsible for the cost of shipping. You pay for this when you pick them up at the airport (Usually around $175 depending for most puppies\/small dogs). However, if your new baby must fly American, the cost of the flight must be paid up front. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPayment Information\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe adoption fee, health certificate, crate costs and travel expenses are due before the puppy is sent home. We accept Paypal or you can send a money order via USPS, UPS or Fed Ex. Please contact us if you have any questions.\r\n ","about":"Rescue Volunteer Adoptions is a group of volunteer dog lovers whose mission is to rescue, provide sanctuary, and ultimately to re-home abandoned, stray and neglected dogs.

Adoption fees are listed below. Adoption applications may be submitted only during viewing and adoption hours. If you arrive before the designated viewing and adoption hours, you will be asked to wait until we are open or return at the appropriate time.\r\n\r\nVirginia law requires that all dogs, cats and rabbits adopted from the shelter be spayed or neutered as part of the adoption process (if the animal is not already spayed or neutered). The adoption fee includes the spay\/neuter surgery fee (if necessary). The fee also includes a distemper vaccination, deworming, flea and tick treatment, and a free health check from a participating Loudoun County veterinarian.\r\n\r\nAdoption counselors are available to provide information about the animals and to answer questions. Adopting a pet represents a commitment to care for the animal for potentially many years. Adopters are encouraged to spend as much time as possible with the animal to ensure that the animal is the best match for their home and lifestyle.\r\n\r\nSteps in the Adoption Process\r\n1. If you are adopting a dog, you will first complete a Meet Your Match survey and get a color card. This color will correspond to the color cards on the dog kennels to help find your best match.\r\n\r\n2. Visit with the animals. An adoption counselor will assist you in making your selection.\r\n\r\n3. Submit an adoption application. The application will be reviewed within 24-72 hours and you will be notified if any additional information is needed. Animals generally do not go home the same day that an application is submitted.\r\n\r\n4. Finalize your adoption contract. This may take place at the same time as you submit your application.\r\n\r\n5. Pick up your new pet! This would happen at the Shelter if your pet is already spayed\/neutered. If not, you would pick him\/her up from the veterinarian\u2019s office after surgery.\r\n\r\nRemember that even though we take the best possible care of animals at our shelter, we do not always know their prior medical history or vaccination status. We perform basic health checkups, but do not have veterinarians on staff. It is very important to take advantage of the free health checkup offered by our participating veterinarians as soon as possible after adoption. The office visit is free, but the veterinarian may recommend vaccinations and other care that you may wish to consider.\r\n\r\nAdoption Fees\r\nDogs\r\n\r\nMale: $70.00\r\nNeutered male: $30.00\r\nFemale: $75.00\r\nSpayed female: $30.00\r\n\r\nCats\r\n\r\nMale: $50.00\r\nNeutered male: $10.00\r\nFemale: $60.00\r\nSpayed female: $10.00\r\n\r\nRabbits: $5.00\r\n\r\nOther Animals: Varies\r\n","about":"We are a county owned facility providing all animal control and sheltering services in Loudoun County, VA.","meetPets":"At the shelter during business hours: Mon, Tue, Thu, and Fri 1-6pm; Wed 1-8pm; Sat 11am-5pm.

As one of the first humane societies in the United States, our original purpose was to prevent cruelty and provide refuge for both animals and children. To this day, we investigate cruelty to animals and provide homeless, abused and abandoned animals with protection and safety. TAHS is a private, non-profit organization and receives no funding from the United Way, the government, or national humane organizations. Donations from local individuals, corporations and generated by our fundraisers are the sole source of funding. Programs like Forever Friends, for people who include TAHS in their wills, and the Golden Paw League, for people who give gifts of $100 or more, have been established to give people donation options and to recognize their generosity. Volunteers help supplement the staff assisting with tasks both inside and outside of our facility. Volunteers provide enrichment for animals such as walking dogs or socializing cats. The Humane Education and Pet Therapy Visitation programs are dependent on our volunteers. Foster care volunteers provide a safe, nurturing environment for animals too young for adoption and for sick or injured animals. It is our goal to help every animal at-risk for abandonment or cruelty, and to find a home for every adoptable animal. The Humane Society is the only animal welfare group in this community who will give refuge to any animal at-risk for abuse or neglect, regardless of its type, health, age or whether we have space. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","meetPets":"The Toledo Area Humane Society offers adoptions at our main office at 1920 Indianwood Circle in Maumee as well as one of our several off site locations.

We provide shelter and care to the homeless and unwanted animals in Woodford County, surrounding counties, as well as animals from other states.\r\n\r\nWe have welcomed thousands of animals every year since 1975 and strive to find good, loving homes for all of them. A careful screening process helps us match the right animals to the right adoptive homes.\r\n\r\nWith no government funding, we are completely dependent on private contributions to continue to provide care to over one thousand animals each year. In 2007, the Woodford Humane Society found homes for 90% of our animals! The national average is around 25%. Our mission is to promote the well-being of animals through S.A.V.E: Spay\/Neuter, Adopt, Volunteer and Educate. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, we joined a nationwide campaign called No More Homeless Pets. The mission of this effort is \"to help bring about a time when every cat and dog that\u2019s ever born can be guaranteed a good life with a loving family.\" At the Woodford Humane Society, we are striving to accomplish this mission through four areas, nicknamed SAVE: Spay\/Neuter, Adopt, Volunteer, and Educate.\r\n\r\nAt any given time, we are home to approximately 200 animals available for adoption. Adoption counselors are on staff to assist with the selection of a new pet. We maintain a \"wish book\" for people seeking a particular breed and let them know when a match has been made.\r\n\r\nAdoption fees include spay or neuter surgery, vaccinations and deworming while at our Adoption Center, a distemper shot, kennel cough vaccine, feline leukemia and FIV screening for cats, a coupon for a free rabies shot, a free veterinary checkup and dog training DVD.\r\n\r\nWe provide counseling and offer advice for topics such as obedience training, housebreaking, helping your pet adapt to a new home and other behavioral issues.\r\n\r\nOur open-door policy means that we take in animals in need, regardless of their temperament, health, age or breed so long as we have the room to accommodate them. The Woodford Humane Society strives to find each and every orphaned pet a good and loving home. All of our animals are evaluated based on health, known history and temperament before being placed for adoption. We get to know our animals well and provide the enrichment and the playtime they need to stay happy.\r\n\r\nAdoptable animals are held for as long as health, behavior and space permit. We have no standard set time for adoptable animals to find a new home, in fact some have stayed in our care for over a year as they await their new home.\r\n\r\nOwner surrendered animals are by appointment. This ensures that we have available space and reduces stress for everyone. Please call us at 859.873.5491 to make an appointment.\r\n\r\nAll animals received must pass an evaluation based on their health, known history and temperament before being placed for adoption.","meetPets":"The Woodford Humane Society's Adoption Center is located at 265 Thomas Lane in Versailles, Kentucky. \r\nHours: \r\nMonday-Friday: Noon-6:00pm\r\nSaturday & Sunday: Noon-5:00pm\r\nVisit woodfordhumane.org for holiday hours.\r\n","services":"Our mission is S.A.V.E: Spay\/Neuter, Adopt, Volunteer and Educate","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

If for any reason during this one-week trial period you feel that the animal is not a perfect match for your family, you can return the animal to 2PawsUp for a full refund.\r\n5. After the one-week trial period is over, the animal is yours to love and cherish forever.\r\n6. If for any reason you are unable to keep the animal, you must return the animal to 2PawsUp.\r\nLastly, if you have any questions please be sure to Contact Us!","about":"Who We Are:\r\n2PawsUp started in early 2007 when a small group of volunteers began helping to transport animals from the Harnett County Animal Control Facility to people who wanted to adopt but could not make it to the shelter themselves. After months of this service, we expanded our services to a full adoption agency. We are now a recognized non-profit, 501c3 organization in the state of North Carolina. We are a devoted team of animal-loving philanthropists with a desire to make a difference in the North Carolina community.\r\nOur Mission:\r\n2PawsUp's mission is to save animals on death row in high kill shelters; provide any needed medical care; and find loving, safe forever homes for each and every animal. 2PawsUp also seeks to raise the awareness of overpopulation and high euthanasia rates in North Carolina, and to help stop the endless cycle of animals ending up in shelters by spaying and neutering every animal that comes through the 2PawsUp program.\r\nWhy We Are Different:\r\nAs a future pet owner, you are probably looking for an adoption agency that is right for you. Each rescue group should have something that appeals to different groups of people, so everyone can find their future pet. This is what makes us different from other rescue organizations:\r\n\u00b7\u00b7 Our main focus is shelter pets. Most rescue groups focus on stray animals before they end up in the shelter. We try to help as many animals that are in imminent danger of being put down. We do accept animals from elsewhere as well, but high-kill shelters are our main focus.\r\n\u00b7\u00b7 Our adoption fees vary between animals, as we try to keep our adoption fees as low as possible. We do not charge you for something we did not provide. For example, if a dog came into the shelter already neutered, the cost of that neuter will NOT be included in his adoption fee. For more information about our adoptions, the feed, and the typical process please view our Adoption page.","meetPets":"Please fill out an application on our website at www.2pawsup.org by clicking on the link within the page of the animal you are interested in.","services":"Adoptions","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Our satisfaction comes from knowing we have helped an orphaned Doberman find its forever home. If you are in a hurry to adopt a Doberman, LOMDR is not an organization you will have a successful experience with. It is in everyone\u2019s best interest to be thorough and thoughtful throughout every step of our application process. \r\n\r\nSTEP 1 Complete the application and return to LOMDR. You may choose to submit your application by way of regular mail, email, or fax. Mailing address, e-mail and fax are listed on the top portion of the application. Please note that during the application process you may be working with several different volunteers. \r\n\r\nSTEP2 Once your application is received, a volunteer will contact you. Please be patient, as all members are volunteers, it may take up to a week to be contacted. The volunteer will discuss what you are looking for or about the specific dog you are inquiring about to determine a good fit. \r\n\r\nSTEP 3 Veterinarian checks and reference checks will be conducted. It is absolutely mandatory that your past and current animals are up to date on vaccinations and are also spayed\/neutered. Current pets must also be maintained on heartworm preventative. LOMDR strives to help control the pet population and will not adopt to homes with animals not spayed\/neutered unless there is a medical reason or you are showing your dog in the ring. \r\n\r\nSTEP 4 While we are in the process of completing your application, a volunteer will contact you to schedule an interview and home visit. The purpose of this visit is to ensure a safe environment for the dog and to verify the information you have listed on your application. The interview helps ensure the adopting family understands the responsibilities of owning and caring for a Doberman. LOMDR may also take this time to allow you to have a visit with the dog (if available) to see how the family interacts. The adoption process WILL NOT be completed until an interview and home visit is complete. \r\n\r\nSTEP 5 We reserve the right to refuse an applicant if, in our judgment, the home situation is not compatible with the needs of a Doberman or if the breed is not suitable for the applicant. To complete a valid adoption, an adoption contract must be signed and an adoption donation collected. The adoption donation serves to reimburse Lean On Me Doberman Rescue for the medical costs invested in your new pet. All adoption donations should be made payable to Lean On Me Doberman Rescue. \r\n\r\nBecause LOMDR is a non-for-profit group, this fee simply is deposited into a pool of funds to help the next Doberman Pinscher in need of our assistance. \r\n\r\nAdoption Donations are:  Puppies (7 months and under) $300.00: Adults $250.00 ","about":"Lean On Me Doberman Rescue is licensed by the Illinois Department of Agriculture as an approved animal shelter.

In addition, our mission is to provide educational services about training, altering, and the humane care of dogs and to also promote good canine citizenship. LOMDR is dedicated to saving abused, abandoned, surrendered, and homeless Dobermans. Our goal is to restore to good health, rehabilitate, and place them into safe and loving permanent homes.

Our goal is to have an animal shelter in Baker City, Oregon that will help us provide the best service possible to our pets and to families.  We are currently raising funds for this facility.\r\n\r\nHistory \r\nOur group was born in 1988 when two people rescued a pregnant and abused mutt from a group of drug-using people. She came to be known as Lucky. Lucky received a complete makeover, was housebroken, went to charm school and after acquiring acceptable social graces, she was placed in a loving home with children until the end of her days. \r\n\r\nShortly after this rescue, a small group of people gathered to try to duplicate Lucky's good fortune. In 1989, the process of requesting a non-profit status from the federal government began. After almost a year of correspondence, our non-profit status was granted in 1990 and continues today. \r\n\r\nThe original group of 20 worked diligently and in its best years touched over 300 dogs and 300 cats in one way or another (shots, worming, spay\/neuter, finding homes, reuniting with owners, etc.). After 6 years the small group dwindled down to a handful of volunteers. Those volunteers, although committed to their work, became worn out. The group became inactive. \r\n\r\nBest Friends of Baker, Inc. found new friends in 2005 who wished to refresh and revive the original intent of helping pets which will reflect more long-term goals and ultimately establishing a permanent shelter in Baker City.","meetPets":"Online: http:\/\/www.bestfriendsofbaker.org, http:\/\/www.petfinder.com\/shelters\/OR148.html","services":"Foster homes, Adoption services, Animal advocates, Resource for any pet question","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Before we can begin the adoption process, you must fill out an Adoption Application in it\u2019s entirety. The following requirements must be met before an adoption can take place:\r\n\r\n    * Applications will only be accepted within the Dallas\/Ft Worth Metroplex. Please email us if you are outside of this area so that we can assess your situation individually.\r\n\r\n    * Any other pets that you have must be fully vetted, this includes that they be spayed\/neutered and up to date on ALL vaccinations. No exceptions will be made to this rule, so please do not apply if your pets are not spayed\/neutered and current on vaccinations. This also includes cats! All dogs and cats (since it was only recently discovered that cats are susceptible to heartworms some exceptions may be made for indoor cats in this regard) must also be tested for heartworms and on some form of heartworm prevention. If you purchase heartworm prevention and\/or flea\/tick products through an online pharmacy like www.petcarerx.com we will need copies of your purchase history which can be obtained from the online pharmacy.\r\n\r\n    * All applicants must be 21 years of age and living on your own. If you are under 21 and living at home with your parents, please have them fill out the adoption application for you.\r\n\r\n    * If you have children under the age of ten, certain criteria will need to be met before a boxer is placed in your home. LBR will be happy to discuss this with each family as the need arises.\r\n\r\n    * All domesticated animals (with the exception of feral cats) must be kept as indoor residents of your home. We do not place our boxers in homes with or as outdoor companion animals.\r\n\r\n    * We will not place two female dogs in the same home. With the dominance issues commonly seen in females, we feel we can increase the odds for a successful adoption by not placing females in the same home together.\r\n\r\n\r\nONCE WE'VE RECEIVED YOUR APPLICATION...\r\nOnce we have received your completed application, here is a list of what you can expect. We realize that this seems like a lot, and it may even seem invasive to some, but we want you to adopt a boxer if you meet the criteria described herein, so please bear with us. Most, if not all, of our volunteers work full time and have families of their own to care for, and we do our best to ensure that all applications are processed in a timely fashion but we do ask that you please have patience.\r\n\r\n    * An LBR volunteer will check the personal and veterinary references listed on your application. Since most vets require their clients permission to release any records, please contact your vet so that we are able to complete the vet check for your application. Once the personal and veterinary references are checked, and deemed acceptable, an LBR volunteer will contact you to schedule a home visit. We conduct the home visit to ensure that our boxers have a safe and loving environment to call home.\r\n\r\n    * On the application, you are asked to list any boxers that you have seen on LBR\u2019s website that you may be interested in adopting. But please be aware that often times we have more than one applicant interested in the same boxer. In that case, the home best suited for the boxer will be chosen for placement. LBR does not do adoptions on a \u201cfirst come, first served\u201d basis, and in many cases we may make a recommendation depending on your circumstances.\r\n\r\n    * After finding a boxer that you and LBR are in agreement would be a good match for you, we ask that you make arrangements to meet the boxer. Generally, this involves attending one of our Meet Our Boxer events, or we may ask the foster family to contact you directly. When you visit a boxer, we ask that all family members be present, as well as any current pets if possible.\r\n\r\n    * In some cases, we may feel that a particular boxer is not a good match for you and your family, please do not be offended by this. LBR does not take the placement of a boxer lightly, and we strive to do our best to ensure that each placement is forever, as many of these wonderful boxers have led very unstable lives before coming into rescue and we only want what is best for them. We will be happy to disclose our reasons for the decisions that we make in this regard.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT HAPPENS WHEN MY APPLICATION IS APPROVED?\r\nOnce your application has been approved and you have found the boxer of your dreams, there are only a few items remaining in this process.\r\n\r\n    * Our adoption donation\u2019s range from $125.00 to $300.00 depending on the dog being adopted. This determination is based on many factors, to include, but not limited to the dog\u2019s age and any past adoption history with LBR. Our boxers are examined for any health issues, spayed\/neutered, fully vaccinated, heartworm tested, and are protected from heartworms, fleas and ticks while in foster care. LBR uses Revolution, an all-inclusive topical agent for heartworm, flea and tick prevention, or Heartgard HW Prevention and Frontline Flea\/Tick Prevention. While in foster care, LBR volunteers work with the boxers on basic obedience commands, but we cannot guarantee that every dog will learn basic obedience commands while in foster care. LBR always recommends that the new owners find a training center that utilizes only positive training techniques for their new family member to help him or her be the best possible companion animal for you and your family.\r\n\r\n    * Upon adoption LBR will have you sign a legally binding adoption agreement. If there ever comes a time when you wish to give up your boxer he\/she MUST be returned to LBR as stated in the adoption agreement. Adopter also agrees that the provided Legacy Boxer Rescue tag will remain on the boxer at all times, and LBR must be notified if the boxer is ever lost or stolen, we have many resources in the area that could help in locating your boxer should such an event ever take place.\r\n\r\n    * Be prepared for the arrival of your new boxer, please click here for a list of items that LBR recommends that you have on hand when he\/she comes home.\r\n\r\n","about":"For every life there is a legacy.

We receive all our funding from membership dues, donations, and fund-raising events. We are always striving to enlarge our animal rescue operations and expand our services to the community. Our voluntary Board of Directors, committee members, and volunteers are responsible for all SPCA activities. We do not have a shelter facility, and depend on foster parents to care for domestic animals until adoption. \r\n\r\nInvestigating reports of cruelty, abuse, neglect and abandonment is one of our primary functions. In most situations, an animal need not be removed from its home. Education is the key to successful pet ownership and the prevention of future inhumane treatment of animals. Adoption volunteers find homes, both through individual appointments and at our open houses for domestic animals brought into custody by our state-licensed humane investigators and dedicated volunteers. \r\n\r\nHumane education is vital to animal welfare. We offer speakers to schools, adult and children's groups, and individuals requesting information. \r\n\r\nOur public relations volunteers give us important contacts with the media and allow us to reach out to a growing number of people. We also have a newsletter; and offer free animal education articles and problem-solving assistance to the community. Our fund-raising volunteers research and coordinate new avenues to obtain funds for use in helping animals. Since we do not receive any state or county funding assistance, the fund-raising volunteers are always looking for new sources of revenue. \r\n\r\nFoster homes provide a special environment for our animals to receive the love and attention they so desperately need. Foster home volunteers provide reassuring contact for animals that may have been exposed to cruelty or neglect. They evaluate the needs of each animal and provide valuable information to prospective new owners. The SPCA does not, as policy, euthanize, and takes in animals as foster homes become available.\r\n","meetPets":"Our cats are available to meet you in their foster homes by appointment weeknights or weekends.\r\n","services":"adoptions","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Every day, staggering numbers of wonderful animals are discarded in shelters across the country.  Irresponsible pet ownership -- be it, the failure to spay\/neuter or follow through on one's commitment  -- results in a tragic loss of life. We, at Safe At Last, feel these animals need a voice.  \r\n\r\nIt is Safe At Last's mission to help ease the suffering, as well as stop it at its source.  We do this by taking animals into our organization from shelters across the country, fostering them in our homes, providing them proper veterinary care, and then matching them with wonderful forever homes.  \r\n\r\nFurther, to help assist with the financial plight in many of the shelters, we send the bulk of our adoptions fees back to the shelters.  We also do fundraisers to raise much needed monies for the shelters, many of which are barely able to keep their doors open.  These funds assist the shelters in buying the basics (food & medicines) for the continuing influx of animals.  These monies also allow the shelters to provide more advanced medical care (e.g., heartworm treatment, special surgeries), thus increasing the likelihood that these animals will be able to get to rescue. \r\n\r\nSafe At Last is also working directly with shelters to assist in facilitating adoptions directly from those facilities.  This not only gets more animals out of the shelters and into forever homes, but also provides much-needed financial support.  \r\n\r\nFinally, Safe At Last is dedicated to education (both online and event-related).  Educational efforts are multi-dimensional.  We educate relative to stopping the overpopulation problem  at its source, by emphasizing the need to spay and neuter.  We also educate to increase awareness regarding animals already in need, stressing adoption via rescue rather than pet shops or breeders.  Finally, we educate regarding responsible pet ownership and general \"pet-related\" matters. \r\n\r\nAt Safe at Last, we remain committed to saving shelter pets, one life at a time.

We have been animal advocates, contracted with both of our twin cities for the running of the daily operations of the shelter, and our latest adventure returns back to our roots as advocates.  As of December 2008, our organization no longer held the contract to run the local animal shelter, and with that change in direction, we have been able to approach the animal community in a completely different direction.  \r\nAlthough operations have changed our mission has not.  The Texarkana Animal League exists to provide protection and care for abandoned, abused, neglected and unwanted companion animals. We also want to promote animal welfare through programs and services that mutually benefit animals and people.\r\nWe have been able to use our annual fundraiser, the \u201cTails of Two Cities\u201d Day Planner to start three community-based programs.  One helps low income households spay and neuter their pets and another helps current rescuers with medical costs of special needs animals. Finally, we established a foster care program to pull needy animals from the community, as well as the shelter, which will provide the extra medical attention and socialization needed in order for the animal to become adoptable.  \r\n\tOur current Board of Directors, listed below, has spent hours and hundreds of dollars working hard to help our local and even regional pet population.\r\n\u2022\tMimi McDaniel, President\r\n\u2022\tMike Richardson, Chairman\r\n\u2022\tMelissa Cook, Vice President\r\n\u2022\tAndrea Chewning, Treasurer\r\n\u2022\tAmanda Crabbe, Secretary\r\n\u2022\tMichelle Boswell\r\n\u2022\tBruce Flint\r\n\u2022\tJudge David Folsom\r\n\u2022\tPrissy Hickerson\r\n\u2022\tKandy Hirsch\r\n\u2022\tDennis Huffman\r\n\u2022\tKirk Lohse\r\n\u2022\tMartha Marshall\r\n\u2022\tJane Morris\r\n\u2022\tDon Shipp\r\n\u201cTails of Two Cities\u201d, along with a private donor, allowed us to launch our community based, low income, Spay\/Neuter Assistance Program.  We are hoping with additional funds to alter 240 animals in 2009 that otherwise would not have received this procedure.  Along with altering the companion animal, we have included a wellness check, vaccines, and a heartworm test.  This program is provided to Bowie and Miller county residents for the low cost of $40 for dogs and $25 for cats.  TAL fronts all of the expenses for this program.  Prices have been negotiated for the different procedures, but the cost remains the same to the public.  In 2008, the local shelter took in over 7,000 animals and euthanized 5,800 of those taken in, 73% were put down because they could not or were not adopted.  This program can only help by reducing the number of unwanted and unexpected animals in our area.  \r\nOur annual fundraiser has provided the start up costs for the Foster Care Program, but in order to keep all of our programs benefiting the entire community, additional funds are needed.  In the 2009 calendar year, we are hoping to help 96 animals through our foster care program.  Each animal will be placed in an approved home and given standard care.  The standard treatments are:\r\n\u2022\tSpay or neuter\r\n\u2022\tHeartworm test\r\n\u2022\tFeline Leukemia Test\r\n\u2022\tWorming\r\n\u2022\tFull vaccines, including Rabies\r\n\u2022\tA Wellness check by a licensed veterinarian\r\n\u2022\tHeartworm prevention while in foster care\r\n\u2022\tAnd a microchip\r\nThese items will take an animal from no or nominal care to complete care and will make them highly adoptable.  We have teamed up with Petfinder.com and PetSmart Charities to promote our adoptable animals.   In working with our local veterinarians, a budget of $250 per animal has been established for the previously listed procedures.   \r\n\tOur newest project is the LifeSaver Program.  With the current overpopulation issue in this area, rescuers are inundated with adoptable, and many times, unadoptable, animals.  This program was designed to help the rescuers afford the medical expenses to bring an unadoptable pet to adoptable status.  Money has been set aside for the 7 rescue groups from this area to aid them in taking those \u201chard case\u201d animals.\r\n\tAlong with helping in the community, TAL still works as the support arm for the city-run animal facility.  We are hoping to help in opening a spay\/neuter clinic in our local shelter.  This will allow every animal that is adopted to already be altered.  We hold events that spotlight animals from the local shelter, such as PetsMart Adoption Events and Adoption Center, our Pet of the Week program, and a monthly ad in the local newspaper featuring several animals for adoption.  In the Pet of the Week program, an animal is the in-studio guest for POWER 95.9\u2019s Tuesday morning radio show, Provide a Pet a Pad.  That same animal is featured in the newspaper and on a local television station that week.  We have had some great success with saturating a particular animal in all local media outlets.\r\n\tWe know this is just a start, but we believe it\u2019s a start in the right direction.\r\n","meetPets":"","services":"adoptions, spay\/nueter assistance, foster for local shelter, grant programs for other rescues","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

We joined Mike as volunteers in late 2007, and eventually assumed the day-to-day rescue operations as his health declined. Although Mike passed away in May, 2009, we have devoted ourselves to continuing his mission to rescue greyhounds and other pets. Escarosa Greyhound and All-Pet Adoptions is a shelter dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation and re-homing of greyhounds, other dog breeds (including mixed-breeds), cats, and assorted small pets as space allows. \r\nOur organization is run entirely by volunteers, and is funded strictly by donations and small fund-raisers.

Jennifer noticed that Cattle Dogs fare particularly poorly in shelters due to the stress of being isolated from people, confined in close proximity to other dogs of varying temperments, and the lack of exercise opportunities available in a shelter environment. When stressed, they often shut down and seem unfriendly and unadoptable, so their euthenasia rate in shelters is very high.

Whenever possible we also assist dogs who, because of extenuating circumstances, are unable to remain in their homes with their guardians. We are located in Central Vermont, and work with local and national organizations to help prevent needless euthanasia, and companion animal overpopulation. \r\n\r\nGood Karma rescue supports early age spay\/neuter as the most practical and humane way to prevent companion animal overpopulation and needless euthanasia. All dogs and puppies adopted from Good Karma rescue prior to going to their forever home are spayed or neutered. Our organization acknowledges the serious problem of overpopulation of companion animals in this country, and works to prevent unwanted litters.\r\n\r\nAll Good Karma are housed in foster homes where they are provided with attention and all are seen by a veterinarian to insure, as much as is possible, that they are in good health before adoption. All companion animals are spayed or neutered, brought up-to-date on shots, and screened for parasites before being placed in their new homes. When time permits, our dogs are also housetrained and taught basic obedience. \r\n\r\nAll Good Karma animals are evaluated for temperament, and personality. This helps us to place them in homes that are well suited to their needs and to the needs of their future guardians.

We make every effort to save each animal that comes into our care, saving euthanization for only the extreme, and very rare case where there is no other reasonable option. We have every pug evaluated by a veterinarian and they are spayed\/neutered, heartworm checked, micro-chipped and brought up to date on all vaccinations.\r\nAt this time, due to limited resources, we are only accepting pure bred pugs. However, we rescue pugs of any age or health. Our ability to accept an animal is limited to available space and funding. Thanks to you, we have saved many pugs from being put down at overcrowded animal shelters. \r\nPRONC has no paid employees and is supported through your kind gift donations and through the wonderful efforts of our family of volunteers.

CA. \r\n\r\nWe are a committed group of folks who are passionate about animals and passionate about reducing the euthanasia rate in our local shelter. We can not save the world and we will not attempt to do so. We will simply take responsibility for those who cross our path. We pledge to make every effort to find as many FABULOUS homes as possible for our animals. We will not agree to place an animal if we do not believe it is the best match. Our dogs are our priority but we also believe that in order to place animals, the humans also have to be respected and we have to build relationships with them.","meetPets":"We do adoptions by appointment only once we have an approved application and an approved interview.","services":"adoptions, some spay\/neuter","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

We are a growing rescue and as such, we are always learning and refining. Sometimes situations arise that we have not encountered and our policy in those situations is to look at the issue on a case by case basis and have a Board of Directors vote. Votes can sometimes take a couple days. The spirit of our policies is to ensure the \"forever\" part of \"forever home\" to the best of everyone's ability. We stand behind our dogs and want what is best for everyone involved.\r\n\r\n    * We cannot do \"one day\" adoptions. Due to the detailed nature of our process, it usually takes between two weeks and a month to get your dog home to you. The approval process takes around 5 days depending on many factors. We even require our foster parents and Board Members to submit an application with references to have on file in the event that they decide to adopt so that we have complete paperwork on file for every adoption.\r\n    * We keep applications on file and active for 6 months. After 6 months, we happily reactivate applications, but have to touch base to identify changes in the home (new pets, new vet, etc).\r\n    * Applications are good for dogs in our program in general and not tied to particular dogs. If you do not see a dog on our website that you connect with, we encourage you to put in an application anyway - we get new dogs regularly.\r\n    * Adopters must be at least 18 years of age.\r\n    * All adults in the home must agree on the adoption of a collie.\r\n    * An adoption application must be completed and a non-refundable application fee of $10 paid to the rescue. If the prospective adopter adopts, then this application fee will be credited to your adoption fee of:\r\n          o $175 for adult dogs\r\n          o $225 for puppies under 6 months of age\r\n          o $100 for scholarship dogs (denoted by a star on the website)\r\n\r\n            This helps to defray the costs that we incur in the dog's vetting. It includes spay\/neuter, heartworm test (and treatment if necessary), heartworm prevention while they are here, Rabies vaccine, distemper vaccine, bordatella vaccine, at least 2 dewormings, Flea Treatments while they are here, any necessary grooming, full vet exam, and any other necessary veterinary work deemed appropriate by the vet. In addition, senior dogs may receive extra bloodwork and dentals. \r\n    * A fenced yard is a must for almost all collie homes. As a herding breed, collies can be car or animal chasers--it's a natural instinct. Board approval is required for collies to be adopted to homes without fences and a plan for the collie to be an indoor only dog with a leashed exercise plan will be expected. Please read this article on electric fencing to understand why we cannot approve homes that plan to leave dogs unattended in electric fences. Electric fencing used for supervised play may be considered on a case by case basis with Board approval.\r\n    * Adopter has a financial responsibility to their adopted collie to provide health care. They are expected to provide annual vaccinations and vet exams, monthly heart worm preventative, flea and tick preventative and vet care in emergencies and non-emergency situations that may arise.\r\n    * Adopter is expected to provide a good quality diet consisting of food that has good nutritional value and to stay away from \u201cbargain\u201d dog food that may be detrimental to any canines health.\r\n    * Adopter's existing animals must be vaccinated per their Veterinarian's protocol.\r\n    * Collies can not be given as gifts to other families. You can give a donation fee towards an adoption.\r\n    * Until adopters are through our full approval process, we cannot reserve dogs.\r\n    * We cannot reserve dogs for longer than one week. During the approval process, we encourage the potential adopter to prepare their home, yard and lives in general for the arrival of a new family member whether it is from CCR or elsewhere. An additional week may be given on a case-by-case basis due to situations such as the installation of a fence. If an adopter will be out of town or has a vacation planned, we ask that the adopter wait until they return in order to inquire about dogs.\r\n    * Dogs are housed with individual foster parents. Interviewers will not give out foster parent telephone numbers or addresses without specific, written foster parent approval. Interviewers will put prospective adopters in touch with foster parents through email. Visits are arranged through the foster parents based on the foster parents availability and their choice of location (might be at foster home or at a park, etc).\r\n    * Collies require a certain amount of grooming. They aren't extremely high-maintenance dogs, but an owner should plan on once weekly brushing and monthly bathing to maintain their beautiful coats.\r\n    * The pre-placement interview is for the adopter as much as it is for Collie Concern Rescue. We want to learn about what you want in your new family member in order to make the best possible match to your home. We will ask you lots of questions about your past experiences with dogs and other pets, what your current family dynamics are and your hopes for the future with your new dog. Expect for this conversation to take around an hour.\r\n    * An inspection of the new home may be requested to check the yard and environment and offer help if we see any stumbling blocks.\r\n    * If the prospective family meets all of the requirements for adoption, then they may begin inquiring about and meeting dogs in our program. If the adopter, the foster and the coordinators of Collie Concern all agree that a dog is a good fit for the family, a contract will be signed, the adoption fee will be paid to Collie Concern, and transportation will be arranged.\r\n    * On the day that the dog goes home, the adopter will meet at the prearranged location with a collar and a leash. The tags will be transferred, the paperwork given, pictures taken and maybe a few tears of happiness shed, and the dog will go home to live with his\/her new family.\r\n    * Follow-up emails will be sent to make sure the dog is doing well. If there are any problems, mentors are available to help. Visits can be made to help with training difficulties. We will always be here for you. If for any reason the adoption does not work out, Collie Concern requires that the dog be returned to our organization (not given away or turned in to a shelter).\r\n\r\n","about":"The mission of Collie Concern Rescue is to facilitate the adoption of displaced collies into loving and responsible homes and to provide a good interim quality of life for homeless collies. Our focus is on matchmaking the right collie into the right adoptive home.

They often contact us to come save lives.  We travel to the shelters and take as many pups as we have foster homes to support.  They are given their first shots (If not already done by the shelter), and a de-worming.  Their Foster Family will then bathe and love on them until they find their forever home.  \r\nUsing a foster family, we get very accurate information about the dog\u0092s personality.

Because we want this to be a permanent adoption, we will place the dog in the home best suited for him\/her. We will not hold dogs for homes that are not ready to adopt yet or have not yet been approved. \r\n\r\nSentinel Dog Rescue is 100% spay\/neuter before adoption. We do NOT make exceptions so please do not ask. If we have puppies available (which is rare), they will be available to go to an adoptive home with a contract stating their spay\/neuter date, which must be kept, failure to do so, will result in immediate return of the adopted dog with no refund. (this is non negotiable) They will also have an increased adoption fee. \r\n\r\nSentinel Dog Rescue's does not adopt further then 2 hours from Ottawa. A home visit is absolutely required. If we have no one to do that home visit, we cannot adopt to that person. We have to visit and verify and counsel with each potential adopter. When we do the visits we often see something that needs to be addressed that the applicant might not think to mention. If an adoption doesn't \"click\" and the new home is far from the foster homes, it makes it extremely complicated and difficult to retrieve the animal and get him to either the original or another foster home. \r\n\r\nHere is what you need to do... Submit an online adoption application. Once you submit the application, you will receive an email or a phone call from the volunteer, who will ask you any further information, that is required from the application, and will schedule a time with you to do a home visit, should your application be approved.\r\n\r\nWe verify personal and vet references that are given on your online adoption application. A home visit is scheduled for your family. A home visit is mandatory for all adopters. This will involve a rescue volunteer coming to your home and visiting with you. All family members and pets must be present at the time of the visit. If you refuse a home visit, your application will be declined. Once your home visit is completed, your application and home visit report will then be forwarded to the Board of Directors who will either approve or decline your application for adoption. We reserve the right to refuse any adoption. We will notify you of your adoption status We will require you to sign our adoption contract and pay an adoption fee of $500. The adoption fee is listed in each dog's bio. Fees can and will increase for puppies due to the extra vet work that we must perform on them. This will help other dogs in need, just as the one you are adopting. \r\n\r\nAdoption Information: These are a few things to remember when looking to adopt a dog from us. These are only a few of our requirements, not all of them: \r\n\u00b7\tBe an adult with responsibility for maintaining a household (no students). \r\n\u00b7\tHave current identification showing address and\/or phone number. \r\n\u00b7\tHave the knowledge and consent of all adults living in household. \r\n\u00b7\tBe able to spend the time and money necessary to provide for the training, medical treatment and proper care of the pet. \r\n\u00b7\tHave the resources to make a non-refundable adoption fee. \r\n\u00b7\tAgree to provide the pet with an indoor home and be willing to consider him as a member of the family. \r\n\u00b7\tUnderstand that all Sentinel Dog Rescue's dogs are spayed\/neutered, no exceptions. \r\n\u00b7\tUnderstand that all pets in an adopter's home must be spayed\/neutered, no exceptions. \r\n\u00b7\tUnderstand that children's age restriction will be based on their exposure to and experience with the breed. \r\n\u00b7\tPlace personal ID on the pet as soon as possible. \r\n\u00b7\tProvide an environment for the animal that will keep him safe and secure. \r\n\u00b7\tUnderstand that Sentinel Dog Rescue's has the right to either deny or approve your adoption application without explanation.\r\nA Few Points To Remember: You may not be contacted until there is a dog available that might be a good match for you. Every dog will not fit into every household. It is left to the discretion of the Board of Directors, whether to approve a placement. We do not adopt out dogs to be given as gifts. If someone you know would like a dog, have that person fill out the application form. You could offer to pay the adoption fee if you would like it to be a \"gift.\" ","about":"Sentinel Dog Rescue is a non-profit organization based in Ottawa, Ontario, dedicated to rescuing homeless and abandoned animals, primarily dogs from high-kill shelters and owners who can no longer care for them. \r\n\r\nBy working with committed volunteers, foster homes, local veterinarians, and our trainer.

You will be asked to sign a contract when adopting your pet.\r\n\r\nFMAR's suggested minimum donation for an adoption ranges from $80 for a cat or kitten, $150 for mixed breed adult dogs and $175 for puppies and full breed dogs. FMAR accepts cash, checks, money orders, Visa and MasterCard.  This donation helps defray some of the cost for vet expenses incurred for each animal, including but not limited to: spay\/neuter, de-worming, heartworm testing and treatment if necessary, FeLuk\/FIV testing, vaccinations, and other medications as required. We try to do whatever it takes to insure you are adopting the healthiest animal possible.  \r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the animals available for adoption are rescue animals and, as such, have often been exposed to a variety of diseases. Like human illnesses these disorders can have an incubation period up to several weeks. If the animal you adopt shows signs of illness within the first 3 days please contact the shelter right away. If the symptoms occur at any point after three days, please take it to your vet for treatment.\r\n\r\nPlease understand that we will not place a pet into a home if any of the following apply:\r\n\r\n    The prospective home currently has an un-spayed\/un-neutered pet.\r\n    The pet will be left outside unattended for long periods of time\r\n    The pet is intended as a gift.\r\n    Anyone in the household is afraid of the pet\r\n    Anyone in the household is aggressive to the pet \r\n\r\nOnce placed, FMAR reserves the right to:\r\n\r\n    Check on the pet at any time to ensure it's well-being\r\n    Remove the pet from the home if any conditions of the adoption contract have been violated or, if in the opinion of FMAR, the environment is unsafe.\r\n    IF at anytime you cannot keep your pet, you must return it to FMAR and not to any other individual or shelter.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdoption Procedures \r\n\r\n    Pet Selection \u0096 This is the first step in making an informed choice of what pet is right for you and your home environment. The following are items to consider.\r\n    Size of Pet \u0096 Is your home environment suitable for a large pet? If you live in a building with various pet controls, is there a limit to the size of the pet? If you rent, please bring a copy of your lease indicating that pets are allowed and what the limitations are.\r\n    Energy Level and Exercise Needs \u0096 Does your home and surrounding area have easy access to a safe exercise area? If you have a yard, is it adequately fenced? Is your fence tall enough for the type of dog which you have interest in (many dogs can scale a 4 foot fence)? If you don't have a fence do you have a plan for potty breaks? Do you have the time in your day to provide the needed exercise and companionship for this pet?\r\n    Compatibility \u0096 Do you have children or do children visit often? If so, does the pet you chose get along with children? Do you have other pets \u0096 does the pet you chose get along with the types of other animals in your home? If you are adopting a dog and you already have a dog (s) at home you will be required to bring him\/her with you when you visit. You will also be required to bring everyone else living in the home.\r\n\r\nAdoption Application\r\n\r\nFMAR's adoption application is used to match our adoptable pets with the best environments, lifestyles, and owner expectations. Please be honest when filling out the form and when talking to an FMAR adoption team member. All applications are reviewed by an FMAR team member for approval.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to attend an FMAR event it will help the process move faster if you can download the questionnaire, fill it out and bring it with you. If you would like to submit an application via email, you can scan it and forward it to shelter1@comcast.net. Questionnaires (applications) are available on our website at http:\/\/www.fmar1.org\/adoption_requirements0.aspx  Please do not mail applications to FMAR as the animal may already be adopted by the time it reaches us.\r\n\r\nAttend an Adoption Event to Meet an Animal\r\n\r\nYou are welcome to come to an adoption event to meet one of our adoptable animals. Please email the shelter at shelter1@comcast.net with the pets name, and the event you would like to meet him\/her at. Please send your request no later than three days prior to the event.\r\n\r\nAdoption Contract\r\n\r\nAfter the pet has been chosen and the adoption questionnaire approved, the adopting family will be given a packet and asked to sign a contract. Included in the packet will be the pet's medical records, pet tips and other informational hand outs, including a packet with instructions on how to activate your free month of health insurance. Please make sure you check your email as soon as you get home and follow the instructions if you do not receive the email. \r\n\r\nFMAR's goal is to make your adoption experience a pleasant one for both your family and the pet. We will do our best to fit the right pet with your family. If you have any questions during the process please feel free to ask. All questions are important to ensure the pet and family have the best possible start as well as continued success.    \r\n\r\n","about":"FMAR is a no-kill animal shelter.

I want to make it stop and over the years have put myself 40,000.00 in debt. The shelter originally started in my home but then the City said I was breaking the by law of 2 animals per household so I had to open a shelter to the tune of 2500.00 plus a month. I currently have 500+ cats and 20 dogs under my umbella and need desperate help, a piece of property for a Sanctuary would be nice.

SouthWest Airedale Terrier (SWAT) Rescue is not an organization or corporation. We are an informal association of independent rescue volunteers. Each volunteer is responsible for the rescued Airedales in their care. Each of us operates in a slightly different fashion, but we all have one thing in common: we are dedicated to finding the perfect home for each individual Airedale in our care. \r\n\r\nSWAT volunteers include Airedale pet owners & breeders who believe we have a responsibility not only for our own dogs and the dogs we produce, but for the Airedale breed as a whole. \r\n\r\nThe SWAT volunteers have full-time jobs, families, and animals of their own and many work more hours doing rescue work than they do at their full-time jobs. While SWAT volunteers make every effort to return phone calls\/emails promptly, this may not always happen. Please, be patient with us. Emergency calls about the safety of Airedales take priority. \r\n\r\nEach volunteer of the Southwest Airedale Terrier Rescue network has the following goals: \r\nTo rescue any purebred Airedale in our area without a responsible owner or breeder. \r\nBefore placement, each rescued Airedale Terrier will be: \r\nspayed or neutered \r\npermanently identified with a microchip \r\nchecked for heartworm, parasites and other health issues \r\nbrought up to date on vaccinations required by law and \r\nappropriate to the age and health of the Airedale, \r\ncarefully evaluated for temperament & personality \r\nin order to be matched with an appropriate home \r\nbathed and groomed \r\nPlace each rescued Airedale Terriers into the loving forever home best suited to the needs of that particular Airedale. \r\nEducate the public regarding the Airedale breed and responsible dog ownership. \r\nNo SWAT volunteer conducts rescue activities for personal profit. All profits from fundraising activities, fees and donations will be used only for the benefit of rescued Airedales.

All Pit Bulls are neutered FREE of charge.  The clinic is operated by our fully trained medical staff, which includes a veterinarian and two technicians.\r\n\r\nThe professionals in SASF\u2019s Training and Behavior Department evaluate each shelter dog and develop individually tailored training plans, depending on the dog\u2019s disposition and needs.  We also have a program for dogs with special needs, including shy and deaf dogs. A well-trained dog with a positive behavior is one that will adjust well into a new adoptive family!  Our popular dog obedience classes, available to the public, provide an opportunity to foster a stronger bond between you and your pooch, to have fun, and to avoid turning your dog in to a shelter due to a lack of training. \r\n\r\nSASF is a young, 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization.

All our animals are seen by our vets, spayed\/neutered, given approriate vaccines, some are microchipped, FELV\/FIV tested if they are cats, heartworm tested for dogs and given flea treatment prior to adoption.","meetPets":"Our cats can be seen 7 days a week at:\r\nPETsMART Aliso Viejo\r\n26762 Aliso Creek Rd.\r\nAliso Viejo, CA  92656\r\nAdoption hours: Saturday and Sunday 12 noon - 4 p.m.\r\n\r\nSome of our cats are also in foster homes so please call Hana at (949)716-0538 or email her at hanaskids@earthlink.net to set up an appointment to visit a kitty in foster care or to visit them at Petsmart.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease contact Diane at(949)348-8057 or dawglady@cox.net to set up an appointment to visit with one of our wonderful dogs available for adoption.","services":"adoptions","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

The Application can be found at the Adoption drop-down menu on the navigation bar above or by clicking here:  Echo Dogs Application Form\r\n\r\nThe application is sent electronically to our processing team, where references are checked.  (Yes, we really do call your references!)\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nWe will call and speak with references listed on your application.  The information provided to us by your references is kept strictly confidential.  We believe that we get honest information by assuring references that we will not disclose to anyone the content of our conversations.\r\n\r\nYou should call your references to let them know that they may be contacted by Echo Dogs.  Occasionally, we have encountered some references, such as veterinarians, who are reluctant to speak with us unless they have your permission.  It is easier for all of us if you let them know to expect our call.\r\n\r\nNo application can be approved without veterinary and personal references.\r\n\r\nHOME VISIT\r\n\r\nAfter your application has passed through the reference checks, we will work to get a home visit set up.  Either an Echo Dogs volunteer or someone who has agreed to help us (usually another rescue group or animal shelter volunteer) will contact you to set up the home visit.  We will contact you to let you know who will be working with you to find a mutually-convenient time for conducting the home visit.\r\n\r\nHome visits are not scary!!  This is often the most nerve-wracking part of our application approval process -- but it needn't be.  The home visit is designed to accomplish three main goals:  1.  To verify that the information provided on the application is true and accurate; 2.  To determine whether the home has the ability to provide a safe, loving environment for a dog through Echo Dogs; and 3.  To help determine the personality of the dog that would best suit the home and family.\r\n\r\n \r\nMATCHING DOGS\r\n\r\nAfter your application has passed all reference checks and the home visit, you are approved to adopt one of our dogs!  However, not every dog is appropriate for every home.  We will work with you to find the dog that is best suited for your home, family and lifestyle.  We want you to get a dog that will enrich your life and delight you and we want each one of our dogs to have a home and family that thinks he or she is the absolute best dog on the planet. \r\n\r\nOur Adoption Coordinator takes over at this point in the process.  She will look at your application and home visit report and will send your application to the foster home that has a dog she thinks you might be interested in.  The foster home will either call or e-mail you with some information about the dog.  You should ask as many questions as you feel necessary to understand whether this dog is the \"one\" for you.  If you don't think one sounds just right, just let the foster home or the Adoption Coordinator know and we will look for a different dog.  If you can tell us why a particular dog didn't appeal to you, it will help us look at other dogs in our program that might be more suitable.\r\n\r\nPlease do not feel pressured to adopt any dog that you aren't absolutely comfortable about adopting!  Each of us loves our foster dogs, but we realize that he or she might not be the right dog for every family or home.  We do not feel offended or hurt if you decide you would rather adopt a dog other than our personal foster dog.  After all, our goal is to get our foster dog into a home where she or he will be truly treasured.\r\n\"I WANT THIS DOG...\"\r\n\r\nWhen you have found the dog that you want to adopt, let the foster home or the Adoption Coordinator know and the Adoption Coordinator will work with you to finalize the adoption.\r\n\r\n\"...BUT HE'S SO FAR AWAY\"\r\n\r\nWe understand that our dogs are often in places far away from the adopters.  Depending on the distances involved, we have various options available, which we can discuss prior to finalize the adoption.  Bear in mind, that the transportation, depending on the distances involved, the speed with which you want to receive the dog and sometimes just plain luck, may involve some additional expense and almost always require you to drive some distance to pick up the dog.\r\n \r\n\r\nDONATION\r\n\r\nWe ask for each of our adopters to make a minimum donation to Echo Dogs to adopt one of our dogs.  Currently, we request a minimum of $300, which is roughly equivalent to the average veterinary expenses we spend on our dogs.\r\n\r\nWHAT'S INCLUDED\r\n\r\n \r\nEach of our dogs, at the time of adoption, will be current on their vaccinations (DHPP, rabies and bordatella), have a negative heartworm test and fecal exam, will have been spayed or neutered and have a microchip implanted.  We keep each of our dogs on Heartgard or Interceptor and Frontline Plus while in foster care. \r\n\r\nMany of our dogs have received considerably more medical treatment than the above, depending on what they need when they arrive into foster care.  If a dog has a chronic condition that is diagnosed while in our care, we will inform you of the diagnosis and the course of treatment that the dog has been receiving while in our care. \r\n\r\n \r\nWHEN IN DOUBT, JUST ASK\r\n\r\nWe gladly answer any questions about our process, or any of our dogs.  Just ask! ","about":"How We Work\r\n\r\nWhere we get our dogs:\r\n\r\nMost of our dogs come from animal control facilities (also known as dog pounds or \"doggie jail\").  They have either been found as strays or abandoned there by their prior owners.  We also accept dogs directly from owners who no longer want them - most of the time, it's due to a change in their family circumstances and they find that the dog simply no longer fits into their plans, but sometimes it's truly an unfortunate set of events that require them to relinquish a beloved pet.\r\n\r\nHow do we choose which dogs we accept:\r\n\r\nThere are three main criteria we use to determine which dogs come into our organization for rehoming. \r\n\r\nFirst, and most importantly, is the temperament of the dog.  In an ideal world, this would be the only criteria we would apply to accepting a dog for rehoming.  We try to get as good a behavioral assessment as we can prior to committing to taking the dog.  If a dog is still with its owner, we require that the dog be assessed by a professional selected by us before we will agree to accept the dog. \r\n\r\nSecond, whether we have an open foster space available.  This, sadly for many dogs, is simply a matter of lucky timing.  We have no physical facility, so we have to wait for a dog to be adopted before we have a foster space available (although we dream of having a facility some day).  Foster space is definitely the bottleneck in our ability to save more dogs. \r\n\r\nThird, if we have a way to get the dog transported from where it is to where the foster home is located.  We sometimes have a dog in one state, but the open foster space is in a different state. If we have volunteers to help transport, we have to incur expense to board the dog for at least two weeks, get its vaccinations and have a health certificate issued in its home state before we transport the dog across into another state for fostering.  If we have the funds and volunteers available, we can save the dog.\r\n\r\n \r\nWhere are the dogs located:\r\n\r\nOnce a dog enters our program, he or she lives in a foster home. Our foster homes are in many different states.  The dog lives as a member of the foster family until he or she is adopted.   The foster parents learn all about the dog and can give potential adopters a detailed description of the dog's personality and quirks.\r\n\r\nWhat keeps us going:\r\n\r\nWE LOVE PHOTOS AND UPDATES!  Hearing that our dogs are doing well and that you're happy with them is what keeps us going in this otherwise fairly grim business.  Please keep us posted on significant events or just whenever you happen to think of it.  We love to hear from you!","meetPets":"www.echodogs.org","services":"Adoptions\/spay\/neuter\/microchip\/fully vetted","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

We rescue animals from all over the state of California as well as complete full scale rescues all over the country as well as over seas.","adoptionProcess":"  Adoption Procedures:\r\n\r\nOur mission is to find the best possible homes for the animals in our care. Many of them have been through severe hardship, mistreatment or neglect, and that makes it even more important that we do our best for them. This means that we have to have guidelines because not every adopter is right for every animal. We try to do right by every person who comes our way looking for a new family pet. But sometimes we have to say \u0093no\u0094 to a potential adopter. Our animals do not have a say in where they go; since we speak for those who have no voice, we must do it well. Our rejection of an adoption application is no reflection on the adopter. Everyone who wants to adopt an animal from a shelter or rescue group is special because they open their homes to those in need. But, while we try to meet the needs of everyone, our clients are the animals. They have no one else. We appreciate your understanding.\r\n\r\n  Get acquainted: We recommend spending no less than an hour of one-on-one time; this helps to ensure compatibility.\r\n\r\n    Housing Requirements: If you rent, we require a copy of your lease or a letter from your landlord stating you are allowed to have the animal you are interested in.  This letter needs to be on your landlord's letterhead, and with appropriate contact information to verify the pets-allowed policy.\r\n\r\n    Bring your existing dog(s) if you are adopting another one:  We want to make sure your existing pet loves your new friend as much as you do. Meeting on neutral territory will make the selection and introduction process that much easier.  Please do not bring your own dog(s) into the building; this would put them at risk of exposure to communicable diseases.  If you have cats at home, we will do a cat test with our feline shelter residents.  Often dogs in a new environment will not display a prey drive towards cats during the first couple of weeks of acclimation; this test is only meant to indicate to us an immediate failure if the dog shows aggression.\r\n\r\n     All family members and\/or roommates must meet the animal: Some small children are allergic to cats or dogs, but their parents are not aware of it yet. Some elderly family members can't handle the size or activity level of some of our canine guests. Some animals get along perfectly with one person, yet may act aggressive toward another.  Bringing everyone who will be a part of the family or the household is critical to the success of the adoption.  Please note that we do not adopt animals out to anyone under the age of 21.\r\n\r\n    A home check may or may not be required: Each adoption process will vary due to the needs of the particular animal and background of the applicant. If a home check is needed, we will set up a convenient time to meet with you at your home.\r\n\r\n    The adoption process: We do not start adoption processes within an hour of closing, and we do not hold animals.  The paperwork itself takes just a few minutes, but the adoption process could last up to 1-2 hours depending on the animal you want to take home and the availability of an adoption counselor. During busier times, especially such as weekends, there can be many adoptions in progress; we ask for your patience if you have to wait during this step as we only have a limited number of staff.  If you are adopting a cat, you will need to bring a carrier.\r\n\r\n   Adoption fees: Kittens under 6 months of age are $150; all other cats are $110.  Puppies under 1 year of age are $300; dogs over 1 year are $200, senior dogs are $150.  Fees can only be paid by check, cash, or debit card; we do not allow payment plans and we cannot take credit cards.  (NOTE: Only an amount over the adoption fee is tax deductible).  \r\n\r\nAll dogs in Santa Cruz County are required by law to be licensed; fees start at $28 for one year. License fees should be paid with a separate check made out to SCCASA.  Adoption fees are NOT refundable.\r\n\r\n ** The Santa Cruz SPCA reserves the right to deny ANY adoption for ANY reason ** \r\n\r\nAll of our animals must be spayed \/ neutered before they go home. \r\n\r\nIf they are not already altered, you will be able to pick your new pet up within a few days.\r\n\r\nPlease note that most of the animals in our center come to us with unknown medical histories.  The Santa Cruz SPCA makes every effort to adopt out only healthy animals; however, we cannot guarantee the health of the animal you decide to adopt. ","about":"The purpose of the Santa Cruz SPCA is to ensure the best possible quality of life for animals and to promote respect and reverence for all. Our mission is to strive to prevent cruelty to animals, to stop pet overpopulation, to promote community responsibility and for the humane care, treatment and well-being of all animals through adoption, education, information, and action.\r\n\r\nThe SPCA got its start thanks to Dr. Charles Edward Graves, who graduated from a San Francisco veterinary college in 1901 and was the first veterinarian in Santa Cruz County to treat small animals.\r\n\r\nIn 1938, he donated his land to the Santa Cruz SPCA. In 1955 the Santa Cruz Animal Welfare Association was incorporated. Alva Enberg, founder, was also its first executive director.\r\n\r\nWhen the Santa Cruz County Animal Services Authority was formed in 2002, they took over the animal control contract with the county of Santa Cruz and the Santa Cruz SPCA became a private agency, focused on humane education, animal rescue, and community support.  As a result of the SPCA's shift from a public-funded service to private agency, the only funding they receive is in the form of private donations.","meetPets":"The Animal Rescue Center is located at:\r\n2685 Chanticleer Avenue\r\nSanta Cruz, CA 95065\r\n\r\nTues thru Fri: 11-6\r\nSat & Sun: 11-5\r\n*Closed Mondays*\r\n\r\nThe Adoption Center & Gift Shop is located at:\r\nCapitola Mall\r\n1855 41st Avenue\r\nCapitola, CA 95010\r\n(in the Sears wing)\r\n\r\nFri: 11-5:30\r\nSat & Sun: 11-4:30\r\n*Closed Monday - Thursday*\r\n","services":"Adoption, Free Food Bank, Humane Education.

Concurrently, RHR is dedicated to preventing this by education of responsible dog ownership regarding the proper care and training of Rottweilers.\r\nRHR is an all-volunteer rescue organization with seasoned rescuers who have been rescuing and placing Rottweiler dogs for many years. None of RHR\u0092s officers, directors, or volunteers receives any salary or compensation in any manner whatsoever. Additionally, all administrative costs are kept to a minimum as every penny spent on administration is considered money taken away from the dogs. Contributions are spent on the rescuing of Rottweilers and include, but not limited to: shelter fees paid to obtain the dog, veterinary expenses for spaying\/neutering, maintaining up-to-date vaccinations, various testings as needed for heartworm and tic-borne diseases, etc. Many of the Rottweilers found in harm\u0092s way, come to us in neglected condition with wounds, injuries, infected ears\/eyes, are emaciated, pregnant, in need of special diets, and behavioral training. Rarely, do the adoption fees cover RHR\u0092s actual costs incurred from these situations.  All of the activities of RHR will be governed by or conducted under the control and supervision of the officers and board of directors of RHR.  \r\nWho area the \u0091hearts\u0092 in Rottweiler Hearts Rescue, you ask?  We are five experienced Rottweiler owners and rescuer.  Not one of us will hesitate to step in when needed and do what we need to do to help a dog.  All the directors are extremely familiar with Rottweilers and all the traits with which they come.  We firmly believe in positive reinforcement.  We know there are times when a foster will need assistance with one of RHR's rotties.  We are there for them.  If we need to take the dog into one of our homes for more one-on-one training, we can do that as well.\r\nRHR knows that due to the amount of dogs that have been abandoned, we can't save them all.  This is why we've decided to choose quality over quantity.  Would we like to have the ability to pull every rottie from every shelter? Absolutely!  However, we know that's not possible.  What we mean when we say \"quality over quantity\" is that the Rottweilers brought into RHR will have the best chance of placement into their forever homes.  \r\nBefore a rottie is pulled from a shelter and placed into one of our pre-approved foster homes, we will take into consideration the dog's age, attitude, temperament, and over-all health.  Before a rottie will be brought into RHR, he\/she will be temperament tested and fully evaluated by an experienced member (or members) of RHR, a dog trainer, or veterinarian. \r\nRottweiler Hearts Rescue Rottweilers will be placed in pre-approved, screened, foster homes.  Each foster must complete a foster application and sign a foster contract.  We ask several things from our fosters including weekly updates, monthly pictures, and allowance of home visits no less than monthly by our Foster Coordinator.  In addition, they are responsible for house and crate training, behavioral training, socializing, and loving the dog.  The dog must attend at least one adoption event every two months.  We have the \"Foster Buddy\" program where we match up a volunteer with each foster to help that foster as needed.  This could be picking up the dog for a vet visit or taking the dog to an event if the foster is unable.\r\n","meetPets":"We hold monthly adoption  events (\"Meet a Rottie\") at Petsmart.

When Beth Foster was faced with the prospect of finding homes for three feral puppies -- Jackie, Zorra and Freckles -- she was at a loss. There were 7,000 perfectly adoptable dogs and cats being killed in her county's animal shelter -- not to mention the thousands and thousands of others being killed at other shelters in the area. Where could three terrified feral puppies find a home? Through chance meetings or divine intervention, Beth was introduced to Cindy Rhoda of Pooches on the Move. Zorra and Freckles quickly found homes in the northeast (Jackie stayed with Beth) and the Dixie Pet Underground Railroad had begun. In the ensuing months, Beth and Betti Gravelle, executive director of Dixie Dogs & Cats, emptied Cleveland Animal Control of all its dogs and cats twice--sending the pets to forever homes in the northeast and the Dixie Pet Underground Railroad really began to move. Dixie Dogs & Cats, a registered 501(c)3 is the parent organization with two divisions -- Dixie Day Spay, a low-cost spay neuter\/clinic, and the Dixie Pet Underground Railroad, a pet rescue and adoption agency.","meetPets":"","services":"Adoptions","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

This deposit is refundable upon showing proof that the animal has been spayed\/neutered.)\r\nImportant Note for Dog\/Puppy Adoptions:\r\n\u0095We do NOT allow invisible fences\r\n\u0095The dog\/puppy is NOT allowed to be tied or chained out for any reason.\r\n\u0095The dog\/puppy is NOT allowed to run loose for any reason.\r\nComplete and submit the Adoption Application. Filling out the adoption application is not a commitment to adopt; it is simply the first step in the process. For an adoption application, please email info@dontbullymerescuetexas.org or you can simply do it on line through our website.\r\nStep 2: Be interviewed by an Adoption Counselor. Our adoption counselors are well trained and are required to ask for detailed information about the potential living arrangements for our animals.\r\nStep 3: Meet the dogs to find a good match for you and your lifestyle.\r\nStep 4: The Application Review Committee will process your application. Don\u0092t BULLY Me Rescue is not able to accept every application for adoption and reserves the right to reject an application. Applications are PROCESSED on a first come first serve basis but are APPROVED based on which application is the best match for the animal.  We do perform a vet check and a reference check.  For the vet we are looking to make sure all animals are current on their vaccinations, rabies, on a monthly heartworm preventative and spayed or neutered. If this passes we will schedule a home visit.  We have set guidelines for application acceptance and realize that your opinion may differ from ours. Thank you for your understanding.\r\nStep 5: If your Adoption Application is approved, you will fill out an Adoption Contract and other important documents. The Contract is a legally-binding document that spells out your responsibilities as the owner of the pet you are adopting. In addition, the Contract provides you with a record of the medical care that our rescue provided for the animal.\r\nNote: Must be at least 20 years old to adopt.  If you are renting we will require speaking with your landlord and getting a written document stating you are allowed to have pit bulls where you are renting.\r\n**Every penny of an adoption fee goes towards the dogs' medical expenses. In fact, in almost all cases, the adoption fee falls far short of the actual medical expenses spent on the dogs.  We rely on public donations we receive\r\nThe adoption fees are used to cover the cost of medical treatments incurred while the dog is in the possession of Don't BULLY Me Rescue prior to adoption. We may pull a dog from a shelter that is healthy and we may only have to spend a small amount of money to have that dog ready for adoption. In this case, the profit from that dog's adoption fee is applied to the vetting costs of the many others whose vetting costs are not so fortunate. There are times the adoption fee for a dog that is not healthy starts as low as $100 when it could easily cost Don't BULLY Me Rescue as much as $2,000 or more to vet this dog depending on the medical issues.**\r\n ","about":"As an all volunteer organization, we are dedicated to improving the lives of the American Pit Bull Terrier\/American Staffordshire Terrier and Pit Bull type dogs and restoring their image. We will improve their lives and restore a positive image through outreach, education, initiation of offering a spaying\/neutering program for families who adopt or already own a Pit Bull type dog, and educating the community about responsible pet ownership.\r\n\r\nWe rescue Pit Bulls that are abused, neglected, and that have ended up in high-kill shelters throughout the state of Texas. We are not a shelter; all of our dogs are placed into a foster care program where they will be kept indoors, socialized, housebroken, and taught basic obedience lessons. We would love to save every Pit Bull that ends up in a Texas shelter, but realistically, we can only save as many dogs as we have foster families. Responsible foster homes are one of the most important roles of this organization and without foster families we will not be able to exist.","meetPets":"They would need to contact our rescue to make arrangements","services":"Adoptions and education","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

","about":"The seed for The Barking Lot was planted a few years back when I took in my first foster dog, Patti Cake, in hopes of making a bigger impact by helping my favorite furry friends. Before I knew it, I was put on some rescue email list and received an email stating, \"This dog to be put down on Tuesday at 3pm\". I was utterly horrified and jumped into action figuring out how I could save her. Well, I did and I'm glad to report Raspberry (my nephew named her!) is living happily in Encinitas to this day! After getting her adopted, I thought, \"That wasn't so tough.\" And so it goes...over 900 dogs adopted into loving home and 3 years later...we have The Barking Lot.\r\n\r\nAs well as being wonderful companions, dogs are amazing teachers and we've learned so much from them...first and foremost that they all deserve a chance at a better life and their behavior will balance beautifully if their needs are meet and good leadership is applied. These pups will be the most grateful creatures you've encountered. We rescue our furry friends from area shelters, humane societies and Mexico as they are at risk of being euthanized and\/or abandoned.\r\n\r\nWe are a small organization with a handful of key volunteers and we are just getting started as a 501c3 non-profit, so we're looking for more volunteers to add to the fun and reward! We need both people and donations to help our furry friends, so we'd be grateful for either.

First, the establishment of an adoption center for cats and kittens in need.  TOCP currently maintains a no-kill rescue and adoption center that opened its doors in April 2010 for kittens and cats of all ages including those who test positive for either FIV or FeLV.   Over 1400 have been rescued to this point.\r\n\r\nStage two is the opening of a low cost\/no cost feline spay and neuter clinic for all cats regardless of ownership status or disposition at our current location.    This clinic will provide spay or neuter surgery for $29.95 to any cat with no qualifications, limits, or geographic boundaries except that he or she be deemed fit by our veterinarian. A December 2012 opening is on the horizon and gives great promise to the reduction of feline births.  15,000 surgeries are planned in the first year with many of them being provided free.  A neuter scooter van  for surgery transport has already been purchased.\r\n\r\nLastly, and already in the earliest planning stages, our largest undertaking, the 2015 opening of the first no kill \u00e2\u0080\u0093 open admission feline shelter in the NW, leaving no cat in need.  Without the second stage of our plan and the drastic reduction of total numbers of kittens born every year, the third stage would be an impossibility.  Services will include, but are not limited to feline rescue, a non-profit medical center practicing both traditional western and eastern medicines and providing low cost\/no cost spays and neuters, adoptions, a state-of-the art neonate nursery, housing and treatment until adoption for FeLV and FIV cats, sanctuary and foster care for geriatric and hospice cats, barn cat program, food bank, behavioral hotline, and the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s greatest feline retail store.\r\n","meetPets":"342 B AVE & AREA PETCOS","services":"ADOPTION, SPAY NEUTER, LOW COST WELL CAT CARE","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

By ignoring their plight, we risk perpetuating cat and dog overpopulation, with dire consequences.  Our objective is to reduce the number of animals left uncared for and homeless.  Our approach is to provide direct care, partner with supportive businesses, organizations and individuals to provide rescue services ranging from feeding to veterinary care to finding temporary and permanent homes for these animals.  We also are committed to the idea that education is essential in alleviating the conditions of animal homelessness and abuse and strive to bring awareness through various community and school programs.

All pets already in the home must be up to date on vaccinations and spayed\/neutered.  If references are all good we then require the family to meet the potential dog or dogs they are interested in that would be a possible good fit for their family.  A meet and greet with any resident dogs is also required to observe the dogs' interacting in an attempt to ensure the dogs are compatible.  We do not adopt on a first come, first serve basis, rather we find the best possible match in a home for all of our dogs.  Each dog will have different requirements depending upon age (example, puppy cannot be adopted to a home where no one is home for 10 hours a day, etc), energy level, dog\/cat friendliness (example, only dog home, no cats) and past behaviors.  After these things are done the last step is a home visit by a board member or experienced volunteer.  We check for many things, including safety and if the home appears dog friendly and any potential hazards to a dog.  If and when an adoption is approved we take the dog to the adopter's home and have an adoption contract signed, which includes a clause stating that if at any time an adopter cannot keep a dog adopted from us, that dog must be returned to the rescue.  We also require written approval and a copy of a lease stating adopters' can own a dog\/pit bull for those who rent.\r\nAll of our dogs are fully vaccinated, spayed\/neutered and microchipped prior to adoption.  Any other health issues are addressed as well.\r\nOur adoption fees vary, depending on age, and are between $100.00-$250.00.","about":"Pitties.Love.Peace, Inc, is a non-profit organization based out of Central PA, devoted to the rescue and rehabilitation of pit bull and bully mix dogs and puppies.

These dedicated groups typically rely solely on volunteers that work tirelessly trying to save as many animals as they possibly can. Unfortunately, these groups often lack the funding, time and resources to better accomplish their work.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that hit Fernando the hardest was realizing that although the dogs staying at shelters were physically cared for, their mental health deteriorated daily. With each day a dog spends in an animal shelter, his chances for adoption decline due to the psychological effects of the typical shelter environment.\r\n\r\nIt\u0092s not the animal shelter\u0092s fault \u0096 they do the best they can with what they have. The problem is that they have so little available to them to make any kind of change, and that\u0092s why The FernDog Rescue Foundation was formed.\r\n\r\nThe mission of The FernDog Rescue Foundation is to help dogs at risk by providing foster homes that will nurture their physical and emotional health, help locate the ideal forever homes for them while providing support and training to help assure that their stay in their new homes is permanent. In addition we focus on developing programs to promote pet adoption services and raise public awareness by providing community education of the issues surrounding animal rescue.\r\n\r\nWe are a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.","meetPets":"Adoptable pets can be visited at our adoption events as well as at the foster's home or applicant's resident upon application approval.

The principle then was the same as it is now; each dog is spayed or neutered, given a complete physical by a local volunteer veterinarian, and given the food, shelter, medicine, love and encouragement he or she needs in rescue foster homes while suitable permanent homes are found in the Southern California area.  The program has grown since the early days, and now many more dogs and puppies come to us through concerned people who seek no repayment other than for their direct costs. \r\n\r\nWhen we started, we soon realized we had underestimated the task, and we felt overwhelmed. It sometimes seemed as though there could be no solution to the monumental problem of spaying or neutering every pup or dog our volunteer foster owners wanted to rehabilitate. We wondered if we could really make a difference in what seemed an out-of- control situation. \r\nBut it turned out that the answer was, and remains, YES. By approaching the situation as a series of single challenges instead of trying to \"fix the whole problem,\" we have now saved, treated and adopted out hundreds of dogs and puppies that would soon have died as sick, hungry, abandoned and helpless animals in the streets or homes.  \r\nWe are also help finance spayed and neuter campaigns in Ensenada B.C.

Our goal is to place these dogs in loving, permanent and carefully screened homes.\r\n\r\nWe also provide education about the characteristics of the Siberian husky and responsible dog ownership.  We offer a forum for Siberian husky and other Northern breed enthusiasts to meet and play.\r\n\r\nWe receive no public subsidies and are funded solely through donations by adopters and supporters. We envision a day when all companion animals no longer face inhumane treatment, abandonment or perish in shelters, a day when there are no more homeless pets.\r\n\r\nSiberian Huskies are beautiful.  It's hard not to fall in love with their fluffy coats and gorgeous eyes, it's hard not to laugh at their antics and marvel at their independent intelligence.  But with the fur comes the shedding, with the antics comes possible destruction and with the independence and intelligence comes a rather nomadic Houdini of a dog that wants to escape and run for the fun of it.  Often these dogs are adopted by people who are not prepared for the very traits they were attracted to.  Some husky owners are not prepared for the amount of energy these dogs have and the exercise they require.  They are intelligent, but often easily bored and not easy to train, they can be stubborn and mischievous. Please research this breed carefully before you choose to adopt a Siberian husky.","meetPets":"Please visit our website and check out our calendar to find where we will\r\nbe with the dogs! http:\/\/www.TaysiaBlue.com","services":"adoption, counseling, play group","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

After working with various rescue groups for many years, the founders of Rescued Pets Movement have come to realize the best way to save these dogs and cats is to build solid relationships with reputable shelters and rescue groups here and in areas of the U.S. where pet overpopulation isn\u0092t such a dire issue, and then arrange transportation to get the animals there. Not only is this the best way to save Houston\u0092s shelter pets from euthanasia, but we believe it will be the impetus in helping Houston shelters become no-kill shelters.

Prospective adopters are encouraged to meet various dogs and to bring all family members and existing pets to meet the dogs they are interested in.

Adopters pledge to love and care for the adopted dog throughout its entire lifetime.

Because we want this to be a permanent adoption, we will place the dog in the home best suited for him\/her. We will not hold dogs for homes that are not ready to adopt yet or have not yet been approved.\r\n\r\nGenesis Dog Rescue is 100% spay\/neuter before adoption. We do NOT make exceptions so please do not ask. If we have puppies available (which is rare), they will be available to go to an adoptive home with a contract stating their spay\/neuter date, which must be kept, failure to do so, will result in immediate return of the adopted dog with no refund. (this is non negotiable) They will also have an increased adoption fee.\r\n\r\nGenesis Dog Rescue's does not adopt further then 2 hours from Ottawa. A home visit is absolutely required. If we have no one to do that home visit, we cannot adopt to that person. We have to visit and verify and counsel with each potential adopter. When we do the visits we often see something that needs to be addressed that the applicant might not think to mention. If an adoption doesn't \"click\" and the new home is far from the foster homes, it makes it extremely complicated and difficult to retrieve the animal and get him to either the original or another foster home.\r\n\r\nHere is what you need to do... Submit an online adoption application. Once you submit the application, you will receive an email or a phone call from the volunteer, who will ask you any further information, that is required from the application, and will schedule a time with you to do a home visit, should your application be approved.\r\n\r\nWe verify personal and vet references that are given on your online adoption application. A home visit is scheduled for your family. A home visit is mandatory for all adopters. This will involve a rescue volunteer coming to your home and visiting with you. All family members and pets must be present at the time of the visit. If you refuse a home visit, your application will be declined. Once your home visit is completed, your application and home visit report will then be forwarded to the Board of Directors who will either approve or decline your application for adoption. We reserve the right to refuse any adoption. We will notify you of your adoption status We will require you to sign our adoption contract and pay an adoption fee of $300.00 to $400.00 but this can and will vary depending on the dog you are adopting. The adoption fee is listed in each dog's bio. Fees can and will increase for puppies due to the extra vet work that we must perform on them. This will help other dogs in need, just as the one you are adopting.\r\n\r\nAdoption Information: These are a few things to remember when looking to adopt a dog from us. These are only a few of our requirements, not all of them:\r\n\r\n    Be an adult with responsibility for maintaining a household (no students).\r\n    Have current identification showing address and\/or phone number.\r\n    Have the knowledge and consent of all adults living in household.\r\n    Be able to spend the time and money necessary to provide for the training, medical treatment and proper care of the pet.\r\n    Have the resources to make a non-refundable adoption fee.\r\n    Agree to provide the pet with an indoor home and be willing to consider him as a member of the family.\r\n    Understand that all Genesis Dog Rescue's dogs are spayed\/neutered, no exceptions.\r\n    Understand that all pets in an adopter's home must be spayed\/neutered, no exceptions.\r\n    Understand that children's age restriction will be based on their exposure to and experience with the breed.\r\n    Place personal ID on the pet as soon as possible.\r\n    Provide an environment for the animal that will keep him safe and secure.\r\n    Understand that Genesis Dog Rescue has the right to either deny or approve your adoption application without explanation.\r\n\r\nA Few Points To Remember: You may not be contacted until there is a dog available that might be a good match for you. Every dog will not fit into every household. It is left to the discretion of the Board of Directors, whether to approve a placement. We do not adopt out dogs to be given as gifts. If someone you know would like a dog, have that person fill out the application form. You could offer to pay the adoption fee if you would like it to be a \"gift.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have an adoption application and adoption contract, there is a home visit and references to be done before an adoption can be considered.","about":"Genesis Dog Rescue is a non-profit organization based in Ottawa, Ontario.

Our adoption screening process is quite rigorous and is designed to aid prospective adopters in the selection of a pet that fits the personality, desires and lifestyle of the family. \r\n\r\nSPIN strives to educate and raise public awareness about how to be responsible for and share your life with a companion animal.  We talk about the importance of spay\/neuter programs, the deplorable conditions found in puppy mills and advocate for change.

Our dogs are in area foster homes or they are housed at Rose's..in a heated pole building with a \"bedroom\" (toddler beds, a chair and a radio..so they can keep up on current events) with a dog door to a small fenced area to potty in through out the day and night. Then they get to play in a four acre fenced in area and swim in the pond every day too! We do not have a \"shelter\" per se and only under special circumstances are any of our animals \"kenneled\". They are very well socialized with people and other animals, which makes it much easier to know their temperaments. We do NOT take owner surrenders. But we will do courtesy posts for pets that are vetted and in need of homes. OUR MISSION STATEMENT Rose's Rescue is an all breed rescue for dogs and cats. We primarily concentrate on local pound rescues as we feel these are the animals in the most dire need of a second chance. We are committed to finding the best possible home for each, and every animal that comes into our rescue and we are available to help with any training or behavioral issues for the life of each animal. Rose's Rescue requires that any animal adopted through our organization be returned to us if for any reason the family is no longer able to care for them. Rose's Rescue is also committed to educating the public on the importance of spay and neuter, routine vaccinations, heartworm protection for dogs, and aids and leukemia testing for cats. According to the Humane Society of American over 4 million dogs, cats, kittens and puppies are killed each year. It is our goal to some day see no adoptable pets euthanized.\r\nEvery two months, Rose\u2019s Rescue chooses a few special candidates for a new class of dogs to be trained at the Trumbull Correctional Institution near Warren, Ohio.  While enrolled in this program, each dog will be trained by selected inmates and overseen by professional dog trainer Bill Oliver (www.customcaninecompany.com) who generously volunteers his time with this laudable project.  Upon completion of their training, cell dogs will have learned important socialization skills, have mastered basic obedience commands, and be fully housebroken.  They will also be taught tricks to entertain their future families and friends, such as sitting pretty, playing dead, and give a high five.  All dogs can be visited (by appointment and accompanied by a Rose\u2019s Rescue representative) while at the prison.  They can be adopted upon graduation, or occasionally sooner if a dog has done exceptionally well and is deemed ready to leave before the class is actually finished.  All of our current cell dogs or graduates are designated as such in their individual descriptions in the \u201cOur Adoptables\u201d section of this website.  If you\u2019d like to get a jump-start on training your new pet, consider adopting a Rose\u2019s Rescue cell dog! ","meetPets":"Most of the dogs are in individual foster homes.

I have several foster homes in various areas, and I also post pictures for people who need help finding a home for their pet, which many times has been successful.

If a person can't send me pictures, and they don't live too far away, I will go and videotape the pet myself to place pictures on the internet.  There have  been a few pets that haven't been able to find a home through this service, but it depends on what the pet is and who is looking on the internet.  When we have space available we take transfers from a local kill animal shelter.  We also step in and help people who find themselves with multiple animals and no way to pay to get them fixed.  Usually I will get all the females fixed to get their circumstances under control, and in some cases I will also help with donated food when I have extra.  If they want to find homes for some of the many pets they have accumulated, then I will place their pictures on the internet for them.  We don't euthanize unless a pet is seriously ill.","meetPets":"It depends on who has the pet.

Our companions are special dogs who have not had the greatest start in life but who are willing and happy to \u0093forgive and forget\u0094 and give all of their love to another human.  Because of this we want our companions to have the best of homes where they will receive the love, attention, exercise, and the health care they deserve.  We provide full age appropriate vet care for all of our companions prior to adoption.  We require all of our companions to be spayed or neutered.\r\n\r\nOur Adoption Criteria\r\n\r\nWe want our companions to be adopted by animal lovers who have given ample consideration to the responsibilities associated with providing a wonderful, fulfilling home.   Our adoption criterion includes, but is not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\n\u0095\tConsideration should be given to the time commitment needed to care for and teach your new companion the \u0093rules of the house\u0094.\r\n\u0095\tConsideration should also be given to the financial responsibility of providing for items that help to make your home, their home \u0096 for example, a dog bed, crate, collar, leash, personal food bowls, toys, etc. are all items you should provide for your companion in his or her new home.\r\n\u0095\tCareful consideration should be given to the costs associated with, and the careful choice of, a veterinarian to provide routine veterinary care as well as unexpected care in the event of illness or accidents.  We ask for a veterinarian reference on our application however, we understand that some folks may be adopting for the first time and therefore may not have a current veterinarian, or perhaps have not had a companion recently and thus may not have a current veterinarian.  The lack of a vet reference will not automatically disqualify an applicant, however we do ask that adopters do their homework with respect to choosing a veterinarian prior to adopting and are able to provide us the name of the veterinarian or clinic they intend to use for their companion\u0092s healthcare.\r\n\u0095\tAdditionally, we insist on positive training methods only.  Use of pinch collars, choke chains, electric shock collars, prong collars, and hitting\/slapping the dog or yelling at the dog is expressly prohibited.\r\n\u0095\tOur companions are adopted as indoor pets only \u0096 we do not allow our companions to go to homes where they will be \u0093tied out\u0094 in the yard or left alone in a fenced yard for long periods of time.\r\n\r\nPlease note: we are unable to approve applications from applicants under 21 years of age.\r\n\r\nOur Adoption Process\r\n\r\nBecause we work diligently to place our companions in a home that is a perfect fit for both the companion and the adopter, our adoption process has several steps.\r\n\r\n\uf0a7\tThe first step in the adoption process is completing an Adoption Application.  Your application may be scanned and emailed to our rescue email account at prbford@roadrunner.com or faxed to 252-679-7298.  Alternately, you may mail your application to:\r\nSea Dog Rescue\r\n128 Birdie Lane\r\nElizabeth City, NC 27909\r\n\r\n\uf0a7\tOnce we have received your application we will review it to see if you meet our adoption criteria.  This determination is based on the information provided on your application as well as a telephone interview.  If you have provided a veterinary reference you should be sure to call their office and give them permission to speak with us, otherwise they are legally bound not to give any information about your animal\u0092s vet history.  If you currently have pet(s) we do expect that they are current on their vaccinations and they are spayed or neutered, provided they are at least 6 months of age.  We may receive several applications for the same companion and we do not base our approval on the order in which the applications are received.  We review each application thoroughly and make our decision based on what we feel is the best fit for the companion and the potential adopter.  Your submission of an Adoption Application is not a guarantee of adoption for that companion and we reserve the right to decline any application for any reason.\r\n\r\n\uf0a7\tAfter your application has been approved we require a Home Visit Check.  We want to see where our companions will be living and ensure that it is a safe, homey environment for them.  Our companions are adopted strictly as indoor companions and are not intended to live outdoors or be left on a chain or tether in your yard.  Home visit checks are scheduled at the convenience of the adopter and the Sea Dog Rescue representative performing the home visit check; pictures of the home environment may be required and are strictly for Sea Dog Rescue use and are never shared in any fashion.\r\n\r\n\uf0a7\tIn cases where it is possible, we will arrange for a \u0093meet and greet\u0094 with the companion.  Since foster homes are scarce and we work with many shelters in various locations our companions may not be local to your area.  If you wish to drive to the foster home for a meet and greet we encourage you to do so however, for the safety of our companions and their foster caregivers, this is done only after your application has been approved.

Our adoption fee is $125 for a kitten ($225 for two kittens). Cats aged 6-12 months old are $100 each ($175 for two). Adults cats (cats over one year of age) are $75. The fee includes testing for feline leukemia and aids, the series of distemper vaccines, the rabies vaccines, wormings, advantage so they are flea free when you take them home, a veterinary exam, and the spay or neuter. Microchipping is available for an additional $45. The adoption fee is waived for qualifying adopters interested in one of our sponsored cats.\r\n\r\nAt the time of adoption, adopters must sign a contract indicating their willingness to obtain all remaining vaccinations, treatments, and spay or neuter. If a placement doesn't work out (e.g., a family member discovers he\/she is allergic), the animal is returned to the Stray Connection and re-adopted. ","about":"The Stray Connection is helping with the recent Knoxville hoarding case. 60 live cats and 38 dead cats were found inside the home of a Murphy Road resident on February 5, 2012. The hoarder surrendered the cats to the Young Williams Animal Center (YWAC) on February 9. The Stray Connection was asked by YWAC to help with these cats on Friday, February 17. On Saturday, February 18, Stray Connection volunteers evaluated all 60 cats. Several of the cats had serious medical issues, upper respiratory infections, or were very scared or asocial.\r\n\r\nThe Stray Connection took six cats on Sunday, February 19, and placed three additional cats into foster care on Saturday, February 25. Aslin, a beautiful Maine Coon, is severely underweight, and has a heart murmur. He also had trauma to his tail when he was younger. The first five vertebrae are fused so he cannot bend that portion of this tail, but he can wag the back half of his tail. Maddie is a long haired Himalayan mix female who suffers from cataracts and a condition called nystagmus, also known as quivering eyes. Clawdia is a petite female calico cat who is severely underweight and malnourished. Two of the cats, Mr Finnegan and Sir Keegan, have muscle atrophy in their back legs that should, thankfully, correct itself with proper nutrition and exercise. At this point, they are so week they have trouble walking and simply standing on their back legs, probably due to prolonged time spent in a cage or carrier. You can feel every bone in Sir Keegan's body with ease. He is filthy from being forced to lie in urine and feces for extended periods. Unlike animals from other hoarding cases, they are expected to fully recover and live healthy, happy lives.\r\n\r\nAll of the rescued cats are negative for feline leukemia and aids and about 1-2 years old. The Stray Connection intends find a good, permanent home for each of these loving cats. We will continue to help YWAC until all 60 cats are placed. The Stray Connection is also dedicated to sharing information on hoarding and abuse. In bringing the public\u2019s attention to this, we hope to curtail the excess of brutal and senseless animal neglect and abuse by increasing community awareness, encouraging and supporting individuals to report any information or suspicions concerning possible hoarding, abuse or neglect situations to local authorities (e.g., animal control officers or local law enforcement officers). Please take action if you have knowledge that or suspect an animal may be suffering.

Our rescue efforts focus on Westchester County, New York, primarily in the southern end of the county.\r\nWe often work with other rescue groups and shelters, most of whom have insufficient space for all of their cats to roam freely. Our philosophy is that no cat should be caged,  except when needed to address temporary medical issues. We believe that cats need room to play, lounge and interact with each other and humans in an open environment. \r\nOur facility currently consists of six rooms for cats. Each room has ample windows, pet beds, scratching posts, cat trees, and lots of toys to keep the cats stimulated throughout the day. We designate space for newly rescued cats to be isolated while recovering from spay or neuter surgery until it can be determined which other cats they will get along best with until adopted.  We also offer critical aftercare space for ferals in our TNR (Trap Neuter Release)  program that aims to stop animal overpopulation. \r\nWe currently work with other groups to assist dogs in need, and hope to expand and be able to help more directly.\r\n","meetPets":"By appointment or at advertised adoption events","services":"Adoptions, spay\/neuter\/TNR","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

However, we are continuing the activities we did for another rescues, For Paws Sake, Inc., in our county.\r\nLori and I have been in rescue for over 25 years combined.  Lori has rescued all over the US and Peurto Rico while her husband was in the service.  Lori is a teacher at a private school and takes her animals into the classroom.  The kids are rewarded by being able to help her with bottle feeding and care of puppies and sick animals.   It is just another incentive for learning. In her math classes they are taught to figure out doses for the animal and ozs to be fed.  \r\nDianne is retired and works for the animals as a full time job.  She works very closely with the local Animal Control.   Hometown is very active in raising funds for the local AC to provide Parvo, Distemper, and Bordatella shots for each animal that enters the Shelter.   In that way we are lowering the breakout rate in the Shelter and once animals are claimed or adopted in the community.   We hold monthly vaccine clinics with $10 shots for Rabies, Parvo\/Distemper, Bordatella, and Feline Distemper.  Micro Chips including registration are $20.  We plan to implement a spay\/neuter program in AC and for the public the beginning of next year. \r\nWhy we do it? To improve the quality life and health of the animals in our community, thus improving the quality of life of the humans who live here. Our Mission statment pretty well says it.  Hometown Animal Rescue, Inc is a group of volunteers dedicated to the rescue, sanctuary and re homing of local stray and neglected dogs.  We work in alliance with the local animal control to build an animal friendly community, encourage respect and compassion for all animals and advocate responsible pet ownership.  Hometown Animal Rescue, Inc will accomplish this through educating the public on the importance of spay\/neuter and general pet care and health.  We will set the example of humane care and treatment through our rescue efforts and demonstrate pet owner responsibility we want current and future pet owners to emulate.  It is our desire that other counties see the success of our network of supporters and volunteers and thus implement similar programs to benefit the animals and citizens of their own community.","meetPets":"Since we are a group of foster homes all our adooptions are done at PetSmart through the PetSmart Charities program or at other places of business.

Families are also asked to sign an adoption contract, which is also available for review on our website.  Our adoption fee is $200.","about":"Greyhounds are notoriously over bred to support the racing industry.  According to industry breeding reports published in The Greyhound Review, there were 77,852 litters registered by the National Greyhound Association between 1989 and 2000.  Multiplied by a conservative average of 6.52 pups per litter, the result shows that more than 507,596 greyhounds were born curing that twelve-year period.  Their lives are difficult from the outset.  In order to track the dogs for racing, greyhound puppies are tattooed by three months of age and are individually registered by 18 months.  Of those born, only 78% of those puppies were individually registered during the same twelve-year period.  Because very few are ever found wandering, the 22% not registered are presumed dead.  On average, a revolving baseline of 1,000 dogs is needed to sustain a racetrack operation.  In 2000, approximately 26,500 greyhounds entered the racing system, and an equal or greater number of greyhounds, aged between 2 and 5 years old, exited the system.  Approximately 13,000 dogs were retired to rescue groups for adoption, leaving approximately 13,500 unaccounted for.  This sport has conservatively claimed the lives of more than 1,000,000 greyhounds in its 75-year U.S. history.\r\nKCREGAP is a 501c3 not-for-profit organization. KCREGAP is dedicated to finding loving homes for retired greyhounds. Since its inception, 4000 greys have been adopted into loving homes in the KC Metro area and beyond. The reality is that, because of poor track standards, many beautiful greyhounds come to us with health issues requiring veterinary attention. The adoption fee charged by KCREGAP does not cover the actual costs incurred in treating these dogs. Costs often climb into the thousands of dollars. \r\n","meetPets":"We have weekly adoption clinics at various locations throughout the KC Metro area.

Since then we\u2019ve been able to save, provide shelter, veterinary and other care and find homes for nearly 7,000 animals (mostly cats & kittens through the shelter & even a few dogs through our foster system).  This number is amazing considering we have extremely limited resources and are not able to do much marketing or promotion (most folks have never even heard of us), our shelter is very small (a converted fast food restaurant in constant need of repair) and we have few committed volunteers.  The bulk of our funding comes from donations and adoption fees as we do not receive any government money and are not funded or sponsored by any agency, corporation or group.    Serving the Greater Metro area and through fosters Ft. Collins, Longmont & Loveland, Angels with Paws takes in unwanted and homeless animals, many of which have injuries, illness, disabilities, special needs and other conditions (most caused by neglect, abandonment, abuse & worse), older adults (over the age of 6), and those who just need some patience and compassion (most of which would have been put-down by or turned away from other shelters).   We provide veterinary and other care, food, litter, etc. and a place for them to live until they are adopted.   We also promote and educate the public on responsible pet ownership, the need to spay\/neuter and the cruelty of declawing.","meetPets":"The Angels with Paws Shelter at 2540 Youngfield St., Lakewood, CO 80215 every day (except holidays) from 1 - 6 p.m., Petsmart Applewood on Youngfield, Petsmart Stapleton in Denver, Petco Golden, Petco Littleton on Wads. & Crestline, Petco Denver I-25 & Colo., Petco Aurora on Quincy, Petco Park Meadows and both Petco and Petsmart in Ft.

One fateful day in 1995 while driving\r\nthrough East St. Louis, P.J. Hightower-an avid animal lover-took notice of\r\nthe numerous stray dogs running through the streets. But instead of shaking\r\nher head in disappointment, muttering a, \"If only I could.\" and simply\r\ncontinuing her journey like so many before her, P.J. did something about it.\r\nOn that day and nearly every day thereafter - and every single consecutive\r\nday over the last ten years - P.J. has made the trip across the river from\r\nher home in St. Louis, bags of dog food in tow, and fed the dogs she saw on\r\nthe streets. When she had the chance, she'd rescue them, take them to the\r\nvet, and try to find a good home for them all the while paying for it out of\r\nher own pocket. And so it continued for nine years.\r\nPJ and stray pitbull in east st louis 300x203 About Us\r\n\r\nStill on the street, this dog needs a foster home before he can be rescued.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, four ladies who had become acquainted with and contributed to P.J.\r\nand her efforts, fellow animal lovers themselves, decided to form a\r\nfundraising organization to take donations that would help rescue many more\r\nstray dogs and cats from the horrors of street life as well as allow their\r\nown dollars stretch that much further, and Gateway Pet Guardians was born.\r\n\r\nOver the last six years the organization has blossomed into much more than\r\nits meager beginnings. With the help of volunteers and an administrator, we\r\nat Gateway Pet Guardians began raising enough money each year to begin\r\nfiling a tax return. P.J. now goes through approximately 1,000 pounds of dog\r\nfood per month and Gateway Pet Guardians currently rescues over 100 dogs and\r\ncats per year. We continue to evolve from a small organization to today's\r\nvirtual animal shelter with expert management by our very first Executive\r\nDirector and dozens of dedicated volunteers, an award winning documentary,\r\nand beyond to our future goal of building a physical animal shelter complete\r\nwith a low cost spay\/neuter clinic and education center in East St. Louis.\r\n","meetPets":"Adoption events or personal visits","services":"Rescue, adoption, fostering","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Our mission is to establish and operate a Center for rescued abandoned pet rabbits, offer a robust adoption program and provide educational resources and programming on the proper care of rabbits as indoor companions.  OHRR envisions a community where all pet rabbits live indoors as companions and have access to a proper diet, habitat, and regular veterinary care for the duration of their life.\r\n\r\nOHRR was founded in 2009 by longtime rabbit owner, Beverly May.  After realizing that over 900 rabbits were offered for surrender each year in Central Ohio alone, Beverly decided that Ohio needed a rescue and adoption center for rabbits.  OHRR began with an extensive network of foster homes in order to begin rescuing rabbits and to build community support. In 2013, OHRR opened the Ohio House Rabbit Adoption Center, which is the first rescue and adoption center in Ohio that is exclusively for rabbits. In 2013, we founds homes for over 70 bunnies.\r\n\r\nIn addition to our adoptions program, OHRR hosts Midwest BunFest, the largest rabbit-related exposition in the Eastern United States. BunFest includes shopping from various small animal supply vendors, the Bunny Spa with nail trips and grooming, Bunny Glamour Shots pet photography, a chance to interact with rabbit rescues across the Midwest, and also has over 10 education sessions from nationally recognized veterinarians and certified rabbit educators. In 2012, OHRR developed the Fix-a-Bun (FAB) Low-Cost Spay\/Neuter program that provides assistance in paying for spay\/neuter surgery for rabbits in Ohio, and the program has helped many families pay for spay\/neuter surgery. Further, OHRR attends adoption events at local pet supply stores on an ongoing basis and hosts community fundraisers quarterly. OHRR also provides email and telephone support to rabbit owners across Ohio and in other states.\r\n","meetPets":"Potential adopters can visit our adoptable bunnies at the Ohio House Rabbit Adoption Center located at 5485 N.

The Network arranges for emergency rescues throughout the country, and gathers information designed to match appropriate permanent and temporary homes. It is funded by donations and supported by Jack Russell Terrier lovers and volunteers throughout the world. \r\n\r\nThe majority of the dogs that end up in Rescue are unwanted simply for being Jack Russells by nature and behavior. Owners often find that they were unprepared for the care required for this high energy terrier; they did not understand the nature of the breed, and their instinctive desire to hunt. Owners are often gone all day, and therefore unable to provide the time, attention, and strenuous exercise this little dog requires. We would like to emphasize that JR's need an active lifestyle, as they are hunting dogs by instinct. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the Russell Rescue, Inc. is to have this unique hunting terrier be in the protective care of those who thoroughly understand this dog. This is a very unique dog that arrives in any life with a special set of needs not suited to everyone. They get into trouble. If they cannot find trouble, they create it. If bored, they can apply their extreme intelligence in destructive ways. They require an educated owner and a loving caretaker willing to provide what this dog needs to be happy and safe. Most of life with them involves protecting them from themselves and their own demise. They rarely lack courage and don't take to abuse, even accidental abuse.","meetPets":"An application must be filled out before an appointment can be set up to meet any of our JRTs.","services":"Adoptions","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

This virtual shelter is a local network of foster families who are dedicated to take in, care for and if needed, rehabilitate or socialize animals in need until they are ready to be placed in permanent loving forever homes. Funding for these services comes solely from donations, which are fully tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. \r\n\r\nAnimals we adopt out often come to us having been abandoned or relinquished. Some may have injuries, health issues or other medical needs requiring veterinary care, antibiotics or other medications. If no medical history is available, a wellness exam is done, vaccines administered and preventive medications are started. Occasionally there will be behavioral or emotional issues that need to be addressed - perhaps the pet has been neglected or abused and needs to re-learn to trust. And sometimes the animals who come to our care are perfectly happy, healthy, fully trained and respectable little souls who, through no fault of their own, are suddently in need of a new home. \r\n\r\nThe stories are plentiful and the needs are vast. Our foster families, with the assistance of loca veterinarians, take great care in making sure these needs are met. Funding for these services and needs come soley from donations.

Many of these dogs live in desperate conditions, where they have to fight to stay alive each day on the street. It is a heart-wrenching site for any animal lover, and once you have seen one of these adorable dogs it is impossible not to want to do something to help them. And this is where the story of starting Pet Project Rescue begins...\r\n\r\nDuring the time on Isla we had the opportunity to meet Alison Sawyer Current and visit her rescue, Isla Animals Rescue. Alison could easily be called the guardian angel of Isla dogs. Like Alison, we instantly fell in love with all the wonderful street animals on the island. The many, many street dogs on Isla spend their days looking for food and avoiding the many taxis that will not hesitate to hit any dog in their way. Luckily, these dogs also have a number of wonderful people looking out for them. Isla Animals volunteers work to find street dogs that need to be spayed, neutered, or given other medical care, and when possible taken into foster-care. Some of the dogs on the island are feral and would not do well in foster-care, but many other street dogs want nothing more than a person to cuddle up with on the couch. These dogs are fostered at Alison's home, and a few other volunteers' homes when needed. The dogs are given the vet care that they require, and the love and affection that they have been needing for a long time. It never ceases to amaze us how trusting and sweet these dogs are after all the terrible things that people have done to them. We often say that these dogs know they have finally found the good life and will show you every day how happy they are to be with you!\r\n\r\nOnce the dogs are ready for adoption they are flown to us in MN, and are placed in foster homes until they are adopted. We continue to provide vet care and training for the dogs while they are in Pet Project Rescue foster homes.\r\n\r\nAs of April 2009 PPR also began working with our local animal control to rescue local cats and dogs. We strongly support the animals in our local area as well, and because of this all our cats are rescued from local high kill shelters. About 85% of our dogs also come from local high kills shelters and are placed in foster homes until they are adopted.\r\n\r\nBecause these animals share our homes with us we are able to really get to know their personalities, and are then able to let you know which dog or cat would be the best fit for your lifestyle. We also strive to make sure that each adoption is a forever home for our animals. To assure this we are here to support our adoptive homes with questions and concerns about their new family member if they arise. We also require an application and home visit prior to adoption.\r\n\r\nThese animals know the hard life, and they know the good life...and they will let you know each and every day how happy they are to be a member of your family! Please consider a Pet Project Rescue animal (from Mexico or MN) as your next pet, and THANK YOU for considering a rescue dog or cat for your family!","meetPets":"We do adoptions 7 days a week out of our foster homes.

We work every day to provide a safe and humane environment for the 250-300 animals in our care and to also find loving and lifetime homes for as many of them as possible. We strive to educate the public on issues involving pets and animal welfare and welcome opportunities to address groups of all ages and interests.

Where necessary we will take in rescue dogs that will be placed in loving pet homes.

We only accept dogs which we believe have the potential, after living in our care, and working with us for some time, of being successfully placed in a new home.  We work with each animal to develop the confidence it will need to fit into a new relationship.  We work with the dog and new owner to ensure that the new relationship is successful.\r\nMy first love is with the Pomeranian breed, I have privately worked rescue for over 10 years with that breed, with the creation of Displaced Pets Rescue I am able to work on a broader basis, taking struggling animals, give them love, care, training and rehabilitation and place them in loving homes.  \r\n","meetPets":"We are located near Portland.

We put a lot of time and effort into rescuing our animals and want to ensure the best permanent home is found for our regal canines. Please consider this prior to completing an application for adoption. If you cannot afford to pay a nominal adoption fee, are you going to be able to afford the care of the dog over his\/her lifetime? For further information on why we charge an adoption fee, please visit our adoption donation section.\r\n\r\nWe require all applicants complete an adoption application prior to being invited to meet our pets. The reason that we request the application upfront is to ensure your home and family are the right fit for the adoptable pet.\r\n \r\n\r\n2.      Joe Joes Place requires home visits for all potential adopters. The home visit allows us to verify that the applicant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s documented information is accurate. It is also imperative in identifying potential problem areas on the property including gaps in the fence where a dog may escape or items such as small toys, cleaning products, plants, etc. that may cause harm to an animal. The volunteer will also be able to answer any specific questions as related to the adoption and offer his\/her personal experience. The home visit may occur at the same time as the adoption provided that the volunteer foster does the adoption. If the home visit is not completed by the volunteer foster, the volunteer foster will be in touch with the potential adopter after the home visit is completed.\r\n\r\n3.      When meeting our available pets the potential adopter will be invited to one of our adoption events or meet at one of our foster homes. We ask that all family members are present when the meeting takes place and you bring any current dogs living in the home with you for the meeting.\r\n\r\n4.      After you have completed the application, home visit, and meet the potential dog, you will be presented with an adoption contract, complete with a copy of the dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vetting records. Our adoption fee is $300.00 and this adoption donation is tax deductible to the adopter. All adoption donations are Non-Refundable.\r\n\r\n5.      Joe Joes Place requires that all pets adopted through our organization are altered at six months of age. The fee is included in your adoption donation.  If you are adopting a puppy under six months of age, you will need to sign a spay\/neuter agreement. Once you have spay\/neutered your dog, mail the documentation to the mailing address noted on your contract. We follow up with 100% of all adopters to ensure all of our rescued dogs have been altered.\r\n\r\n6.      Joe Joes Place also recommends that new adopters have identification tags with your contact information made or have the animal micro chipped as soon as possible. We do not intend on dogs getting lost, but unfortunately no matter how careful you are, it may happen. It is also easier to prove ownership in the event your dog is lost.","about":"Joey Lloyd was a vibrant young man with big hopes and dreams. He had just graduated high school in June of 2008 and had plans of joining the carpenters union and going to college. Joey was loved by many. His smile brightened up a room and his sarcasm and sense of humor were addicting. Joey excelled at many things including wood working, but his passion was racing quads.On October 14th, 2008, Joey never woke up. He went into cardiac arrest with no apparent reason. The autopsy and toxicology report showed nothing. All we can believe is that for whatever reason Joey's time here was over and he was called to bigger and better things. In addition to meeting his grandfather for the first time, we believe that Joey is jumping the highest hills with his quad and hangin' out with all the animals who have crossed over the Rainbow Bridge.We honor his memory with this cause.....4 paws at a time.","meetPets":"Visit our Website","services":"Adoptions","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

To the best of our abilities, we evaluate all of our Good Dogs\u2019 temperament and suitability for living with other dogs, cats, and children. A dog\u2019s health is checked, and we make sure they are up-to-date on all shots and are spayed or neutered. Then, we place them in loving foster homes until they find their very own family. Our goal is to meet the needs of each dog as an individual and to assure proper placement in a loving forever home.  \r\nWhat We Do...  Good Dog is dedicated to animal rescue. In addition to our primary goal of helping homeless and abandoned dogs, we \r\n- donate money to low-cost spay\/neuter clinics in the south to help solve the problem of pet overpopulation; \r\n- engage in community outreach activities with local schools to help educate children and young adults about animal rescue and responsible pet ownership; \r\n- team with non-profit organizations that train rescued dogs to assist disabled people. More than a dozen of our Good Dogs have become certified service dogs, helping disabled people lead more independent lives. \r\n  \r\nWe are proud of the work we do with our good dogs and in our local communities. \r\n\r\nSouth to North Connection\r\nEvery month, dozens of our Southern Good Dogs ride the transport north to their new forever and foster homes. The USDA-licensed transport drives up every week to meet new forever and foster families at various locations along the Tennessee-New England route. Our Southern adoptions are long-distance and the dogs are taken directly home from the transport . We facilitate  long-distance adoptions by the transfer of pictures and information about the dog, and we arrange to have the adopter speak to the dog's foster parents.

From the Board of Directors to our Foster Caretakers to our Event Staff, each volunteer gives generously of their time and skills, motivated solely by a desire to help animals.\r\n\r\nA Second Chance Puppies and Kittens Rescue combines a no-nonsense goal of saving animals' lives with the blood, sweat, and tears of countless volunteers with financial support from various donors (individuals and corporations alike). Now in its sixth year, the group has rescued over 5,000 animals and continues to grow rapidly thanks in large part due to established relationships with various pet supply stores in Palm Beach County, including PetSmart and PETCO.\r\n\r\nAll of the grant writing, fundraising, application reviewing, event planning, supply collection, bathing and bottle feeding is done by volunteers who seek only to save the lives of pets. When opening their hearts just isn\u2019t enough for some, they open their doors - fostering dogs and cats in need until they are adopted. Their dedication has made the group one of the largest no-kill rescue groups without a shelter.\r\n\r\nRescuing and arranging adoptions into loving homes for so many animals and successfully treating dozens of heartworm positive dogs are monumental tasks that have not gone unnoticed by the local media. The Palm Beach Post, The Wellington Town Crier and The Observer have all written articles promoting the group and its goal of finding homes for homeless pets.\r\n\r\nAccomplishing our goal of saving homeless pets\u2019 lives by providing them with safe, healthy foster environments until they are adopted by loving forever families, requires funding to pay for the food and medical needs of the rescued animals. Donated funds go directly to covering food and supplies, veterinary expenses and medical supplies, and overhead costs (printing of forms, webpage hosting, etc.). A Second Chance Puppies and Kittens Rescue relies solely on donations. We do not receive any government funding or grants.\r\n\r\nWe hope that after all you\u2019ve learned about us, you will join us in our effort to save the homeless animals.   ","meetPets":"We do not have a shelter location where you can come to meet the animals.  We are 100% volunteer and our animals are kept in private foster homes until they are ready for adoption.\r\n\r\nWe have weekly events as listed on our website under the Events Link, where you can come to see the pups, but if one of your choices is pre-approved for an online application it would not be available for adoption.\r\n\r\nIt is best to pick one of your favorites, and get an application in so it can be reviewed.  That way, if it is approved, you would be able to come to the event and choose from what is available at that time.  Keep in mind though, an approval for one particular dog or puppy does not guarantee approval for another, we have to make sure the pup is going to the best possible forever home.","services":"Adoptions","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Check out all of our adoptable animals HERE. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the process for adopting an animal?  \r\n\r\nThe steps are briefly outlined below: \r\n\r\n* Before potential adopters can physically meet a foster animal outside of our open adoption events, we require them to fill out an adoption application. Check out our scheduled adoption events HERE. \r\n\r\n* After applications are reviewed, suitable applicants are contacted to set up a Pre-Adoption Meeting with our volunteers and we often include the foster parent of the animal you would like to adopt. This meeting is designed to answer any questions adopters may have about a particular animal or our adoption process. \r\n\r\n* Once your application is approved, meet and greets with the foster animal and foster parents will be scheduled with qualified applicants if this has not already occurred. \r\n\r\n* After the meet and greet (and if the applicant is still interested in the animal), foster parents will make a recommendation to shelter staff regarding the adoption. The foster animal stays with the foster parent until they hear from the Diamond In The Ruff adoption committee. \r\n\r\n* Adoption is approved or rejected by the Diamond In The Ruff Adoption Committee. Final approval of all adoptions is at the sole discretion of Diamond in the Ruff. \r\n\r\n* Once approved, another meeting will be arranged between the foster parent and adopter wherein the adoption fee is collected and contracts are signed. The foster animal then goes to its new forever home*.  *Final placements are pending results of week-long trial period. Check out some of our amazing success stories HERE!  \r\n\r\n* A Diamond in the Ruff volunteer will contact you after 72 hours to see how everyone is settling in as well as answer any questions you may have.   \r\n\r\n* After your week trial period is up, we will deposit your adoption fee and distribute your animals vet records and microchip information in a timely fashion.  \r\n\r\n* Please keep in mind, we are a 100% volunteer run organization and we will process your applications as fast as we can.

Our mission is to promote responsible ownership of what used to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe American Family Dog.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We have identified a need for education in animal abuse and breed awareness due to the tremendous number of events of animal abuse and dog fighting in Baltimore. Dog fighting is a growing problem throughout the country largely because the laws for this need to be changed and there is no funding to police for it appropriately. Currently, the penalties for these crimes are minimal. We need reform in our laws for these crimes and changes from the people in the community, specifically the youth. Our goals include awareness, advocacy work, fundraising and informing the public of the prejudice to this breed that the media, irresponsible owners and breeders have created upon one of the most loyal dogs a family could ever have as a member of their pack. We do what we can to help save pit bulls by donations from the community. We look to fight breed specific laws and show they do not work. BBC works to inform the public of the truth there are not bad dogs, just bad owners! Education and awareness is a must if the bully breeds are to have half a chance of survival. Only 1 in every 600 pit bulls in shelters and rescue groups will find a home, the other 599 don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. With staggering numbers like that, why breed?

Upon approval, adopters are required to sign a contract and pay the adoption fee.","about":"CPR was formed by Director Molli Bowen in 2004 to assist the unwanted and homeless dogs and puppies in West Tennessee. In the process of helping them, CPR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s volunteers strive to help thefamilies that find themselves with custody of the unwanted and homeless. Since our beginning, we have rehomed over 7,500 dogs and puppies. This feat has been accomplished thru a vast network of affiliated shelters and rescues plus private adoptions.\r\nCPR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s volunteers are fantastic!! We are a group of hard-working and very dedicated individuals in Tennessee and New England that help support this effort by running vet errands and any other job that needs to be done to help get these pups on their way to being ready for their new homes. We are the Pit Crew\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love for you to join our efforts!\r\nIn 2008, CPR bought a farm to house as many dogs and pups as we can safely and healthily maintain. We aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a sanctuary. While we do have a few permanent residents, our goal is to rehome as quickly as possible.\r\nOur rehoming focus is strictly on areas outside of West Tennessee. There are very few enforced laws in our area and there is no licensing to encourage spay\/neuter. We focus on adopting our great pets into areas that DO have enforced companion pet regulations and licensing and education that encourage spay\/neuter. Thus, 95% of our adoptions are into the New England area.\r\nPeople often ask us where do all these puppies come from? Are there really that many unwanted puppies in West Tennessee and the answer is sadly enough a resounding \u00e2\u0080\u009cYES!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The main source of our puppies comes from the public. We are contacted constantly by families who have failed to spay their female dog and VOILA!!\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.she has puppies!! We never place the puppies without spaying the mother dog. If the mother dog is a stray or the family no longer wants her, if she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adoptable, we pay for all of her medical expenses necessary to get her ready for adoption. In addition to spaying the mother dogs, we have a very strong community outreach spay\/neuter program to assist with altering pets we are contacted about that are in need.\r\nCompanion Pet Rescue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name we chose very deliberately \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we focus our efforts on friendly, social, loving companion pets. With so many to help, we rarely assist in placing dogs with special needs or aggression \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when we do, they are posted with lots of disclaimers and information about their issues. We simply are not equipped to regularly rescue \u00e2\u0080\u009cspecial needs\/aggressive\u00e2\u0080\u009d dogs, as our dogs are at the farm where they are heavily socialized with other dogs (a doggy daycare environment), or in foster homes, almost all of which have children and other pets. The benefit of course, is that when the pup is adopted we have a great feel for his or her personality and that pup has been well-socialized.\r\nCPR also works with a number of kill shelters who have contacted us directly for help and who maintain certain safety and sanitation guidelines. Sadly, we always have more dogs in need than foster homes to help, but we focus on the positive and what we CAN accomplish!!!! And that has helped save thousands of dogs and puppies in need!\r\nThank you for being a fan of CPR and please help us spread the word about our rescue and rehoming program PLUS our need for funding for community outreach spay\/neuter!","meetPets":"Our pets can be visited at one of our many weekly adoption events or at our adoption center located in Southbury CT.

For a senior or special needs dog, the donation is $150. **100% of adoption donations go towards spaying, neutering, medical care and fostering expenses of the dogs prior to adoption.**","about":"Bow Wow Rescue is a small, entirely volunteer, not-for-profit organization dedicated to providing public education, veterinary care and forever homes for abused, neglected and\/or abandoned animals.

Why we do it: Herding dogs are not for every one. Too many adopters get these dogs as status symbols only to find out, their life style doesn't meet these high energy dogs needs. As a result, these wonderful misunderstood dogs wind up in shelters. We understand what drives these dogs, we can place them appropriately. Our mission is to educate people and save dogs. We do it because we love these dogs, with a little effort, can give them a good new life. Euthanasia is not the solution to out animal overpopulation issue.

Our second goal is to assist those in the rescue community and the community at large with managing feral cat populations by providing much needed food and spay\/neuter services, to help decrease the growing number of homeless and unwanted pets in the Atlanta area and state of Georgia.   \r\n\r\nWe also want to educate Georgians about the need for TNR and for spaying and neutering.  While great steps have been taken, much more needs to be done to save the counties of Georgia from wasting millions of dollars each year euthanizing unwanted cats and dogs.   \r\n\r\nTogether we will make the difference by helping to combat and eventually stop pet overpopulation through spay\/neuter assistance and by raising community awareness.","meetPets":"Buckhead PetSmart\r\nN.

Our adoption fee is $50.00.  NAFA does long distance adoptions - individuals must be willing to drive to Jonesboro to meet the dog they are interested in and visit with our director.  For individuals more than 60 miles away, NAFA must have a working relationship with a rescue or shelter in your area.\r\n\r\nThe procedure for adoption is \u2026 \r\n\r\nVisit our pet adoption and meet the puppy. Complete a potential home questionnaire. Complete an Interview with the director.  Not everyone who applies to adopt an animal is a good match.   \r\n\r\nIf after those step you and the director agree that your home and the dog are a good match, a bandanna is placed on the dog and you complete the adoption with our adoption counselor. \r\n\r\nThe puppy has received the first set of vaccinations, deworming and is on heartworm preventative.  Adult dogs are current on vaccinations, heartworm negative and on heartworm preventative.   \r\n\r\nAll pets adopted from NAFA are microchipped and registered to your name and address. \r\n\r\nWe provide a bag of food of the type food the puppy has been eating, along with stress vitamins to help with the transition from the foster home and its litter mates to you. \r\n\r\nWe provide a reward tag for the dog to wear just in case it gets lost, someone will call for the reward and we can get the pet back to you. \r\n\r\nAll pets are covered by 30 days shelter care insurance. \r\n\r\nThe adoption contract you sign has 19 items of importance, the top four state that you agree to: \r\n\r\nCome back the next Saturday after adoption to bring paperwork showing you have had the dog to the vet for its next set of vaccinations. (This can be done by fax if you live more than 1.5 hours away from Jonesboro)\r\n \r\nHave the puppy spayed\/neutered before it is 5 months of age and provide proof of this.  Most adults are already altered unless our veterinarian suggests waiting for 30 to 60 days.  Your adoption is not complete until proof of spay\/neuter is received.  \r\n\r\nTake the pet to your veterinarian for the next set of vaccinations and to purchase heartworm preventative the Tuesday after you adopt.\r\n \r\nCome back the fifth or sixth Saturday after adoption for a final check-in and mini training session.  This is mandatory unless you live more than 2 hours away.  Then it can be done by email or telephone. \r\n\r\nReturn the dog to NAFA should circumstances change and you are not able to keep the dog.  \r\n","about":"In the past 11 years NAFA has been responsible for and assisted with the rescue of thousands of dogs and cats from puppy mills, catteries, class B dealers, backyard breeders, pet stores and individuals.\r\n\r\n     NAFA has no shelter.

We house & care for approximately 40 dogs at any given time. Our dogs arrive in our care in many ways; owner surrenders, strays & we pull from local high-intake shelters.\r\n \r\nWe have an equal balance of dogs that need medical care, behavioral rehabilitation & some dogs that are just ready to get into that new home today.  All of our dogs leave our care spayed\/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped & heartworm tested (if positive, we treat them). \r\n \r\nWe were developed based on the fact that there is a gap in the system here locally.  The shelters that are open-intake, although they are doing the best they can, they can only do so much.  Those shelters are also very stressful to the dogs & this is where we step in.  You can consider our place a half-way home for dogs if you will.  We allow the dogs to be dogs again, offering them behavioral modification, land to run on, playgroups & necessary vet care.  With this being said, our adoption rate is sometimes slowed due to the fact the dog(s) may not be ready for adoption right away.  We set our dogs up for success & match them with the right family.  Our final goal is to have the adoptions last the dog's lifetime.\r\n \r\nOur #1 goal though is to have a dog stay in their current home, should it be safe.  We offer counseling & resources to do our best to make this happen.  When it's not possible, they may safely surrender the dog to us, provided we have space. \r\n \r\nPlease consider donating to our cause.  You can revisit our website & watch while we grow, or help us grow by making a donation.  We are a licensed shelter through the state of Missouri & a 501(c)(3) non-profit.

ESRA's mission is to provide foster care to English Springers impounded by humane societies, private shelters, and animal control facilities nationwide, as well as to offer adoption referral services for those agencies. There are no paid staff, and all our members do what they do on a completely voluntary basis.\r\n\r\nEnglish Springers are as susceptible to impoundment as any dog. They are picked up off the streets as strays or relinquished by their owners because of a move, illness or death, financial crisis, or other troubled circumstances. Adoption referral assistance is also available to those owners who can no longer care for their Springers and must give them up for adoption. Through the compassionate efforts and commitments to help, ESRA's volunteer members have successfully placed thousands of Springers in new loving homes.\r\n\r\nTo be considered for placement in ESRA's database of prospective adopting homes, click here for the adoption application. When received, and after the approval process, we will enter you in our database of homes preliminarily to adopt available dogs. These listings include dogs in shelters and foster homes, and those being relinquished by their owners.\r\n\r\nESRA was founded March 25, 1998, by Jan Flagg, a Southern California resident. In the summer of 1998, ESRA's management were co-founders of the now-defunct English Springer Spaniel Rescue Coalition (ESSRC), which was an early coalition of independent rescue groups, out of which grew English Springer Spaniel Rescue nationwide as we know it today.","meetPets":"Dogs can be visited at their foster homes.

TBIN does not adopt dogs as gifts.  \r\nTBIN does not adopt to families with children under the age of 8.

They are small, fragile, some are nervous, or even nippy.  For the comfort of our dogs and the safety of young kids, we regret that there can be no exceptions.  \r\nWe do not require that you have previously shared your life with a dog, however, preference is given to applicants that have (and can provide a veterinary reference).    \r\nIn an effort to save time, please ensure that you have given your veterinarian your consent to release information to Toy Breeds In Need Rescue.\r\nTBIN requires adopters to stay in touch with us for the life of the dog.

TBIN uses a blend of both allopathic (traditional) and holistic veterinary medicine to provide a balanced approach to canine wellness.  Our belief is that healthy dogs are happy dogs and so we work to support not only the physical body, but also the spirit!  All dogs reside in foster homes and are treated as members of our families until their loving forever home is found.  It is further a goal of this organization to act as an educational resource for both our adoptive families, as well as other canine guardians who are interested in learning about alternative medicine, species appropriate food, and holistic care for their four-legged family members.","meetPets":"We are a very small organization and only attend a very limited number of adoption events.

We honor a little Boston Terrier named Dexter who was given a second chance. \r\n\r\nThe Dexter Foundation is dedicated to helping shelter dogs and other rescue organizations who adopt misunderstood dogs. We assist owners needing to find homes for their dogs by posting their dogs, screening applicants, and finding them new loving forever homes. We work cooperatively with other rescues and help fund the rescue and care of shelter dogs. We provide a safe haven for abandoned dogs that are passed over. In these difficult economic times, many owners are forced to surrender or abandon their dogs who may need only temporary medical attention. The Dexter Foundation, with your assistance, is able to help save the lives of these otherwise happy, healthy dogs. \r\n\r\nLittle Dexter sat at the San Diego shelter, abandoned by the only person he knew. His owner was no longer able to care for him and turned him over to someone he trusted to care and find a home for him. Instead, the person called animal control on him. Dexter was so frightened, he bit the animal control officer and was scheduled to be euthanized as he was then deemed \u00e2\u0080\u009caggressive\u00e2\u0080\u009d by the shelter, and would not be adopted to the public. Thankfully, he was rescued by a group willing to take on dogs with behavioral problems and understood that a dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behavior in a shelter is not indicative of a dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true behavior. \r\n\r\nDexter had spent the first few years of his life knowing only one person, never having been taken outside to meet other dogs or new people. When that owner could no longer care for him, he was turned out into an unknown world. After two failed placements while he was learning how to play with other dogs and people, he was sent to live with the President of the rescue group who fell in love with him and his lively personality. \r\n\r\nDexter now lives with two rescued brothers, Blue and Scout, and a rescued sister named Annabelle. All were adopted from shelters throughout Southern California. Annabelle and Scout both would have been euthanized if not adopted by rescue due to the fear they exhibited with new people. They have all learned to how to be part of a family and made many new friends. They provide their new family with lots of love. \r\n\r\nDexter, and all dogs like him, are grateful to the many rescue groups who have given them a second chance. The Dexter Foundation asks for your support so that we can provide funding and support to the dogs and rescue groups willing to give the misunderstood dogs a second chance. \r\n","meetPets":"Contact us and we can arrange to meet at the home of the foster parents or your home.

We have also helped with heartworm treatment and various other medical costs of animals in need. Our sponsors visit the shelter at least once a week to update pictures, shots, and check on the dogs and cats.  We take the GAP girls twice a month so they can volunteer and understand why we sponsor pets and have fund-raises. The shelter's euthanasia rate has dropped dramatically since we have been working with them.  We owe a lot of this to networking and the internet. \r\n\r\nI personally get a lot of satisfaction out of working with the shelter and the animals because the animals can't help themselves and they seem so genuinely grateful when you give them even just the littlest bit of attention and love.

Dogs XL operates like a social networking service for dogs, designed to match people and pets based on the principles of compatibility and compassion. \r\n\r\nAs the name implies, Dogs XL specializes in finding homes for large dogs (typically 75lbs+). Large dogs are often first to be put to sleep in shelters because medical treatment and food for large dogs is more expensive than for small dog. Large dogs also take up more space at the shelter and on transports to adoptive families. Although owning a large dog is not for everyone, large dogs have many unique and endearing qualities. Here at Dogs XL, we believe the larger the dog, the more there is to love. \r\n\r\nOccasionally, Dogs XL will intervene on behalf of a smaller dog with an XL personality.

Sometimes alterations are requested before you can have your new Boxer come home.

In the summer months, I had volunteered at a shelter in Yancey Co, NC for 10 yrs, establishing their rescue effort and building a 'state-of-the art' shelter, there. In the winter months, I felt lost and useless, and bored, so decided that I needed to step up to help rescue as many of the dogs I could, in Rutherford Co, NC where we lived during the winter months. In 2007, we decided to sell our summer place, since Yancey had everything it needed now, with a sweet shelter doing amazing things for the animals in need there. Since, Jan. 2004, H4S has rescued over 7,700 dogs and puppies. We trabsport as many as we can get into other no-kill rescues in NY and NJ, and also adopt out as many as we can handle, each month. We average a population of 35 adoptables each month, as well as 35 permanent 'sanctuary residents', mostly older beagles and hounds. It has become my life's work, and I LOVE what I do.

Initially it was a dream.  Soon a blue print for implementation of this dream was in place. Finally a strategy for changes that would most significantly impact the inhumane conditions of these precious pets was arrived at.  Then, in 1997, New Leash On Life Animal Rescue was born, thanks to Bobby & Kelly Dorafshar. \r\n\r\nSince its inception, New Leash On Life has been responsible for spaying and neutering thousands of pets, rescuing and placing over 3,000 dogs, providing free educational seminars at local shelters, setting shelter rescue priorities on \u201chard to place\u201d animals requiring medical or special care, founding the P.E.T.\u2019s program (Pet Educational Trainers) and co-founding Partners for Life which saved hundreds at the East Valley Animal Shelter. Finally in March of 2002, a lease was signed on thirteen acres in the Santa Clarita Valley for our E.R.A Center (Education, Rehabilitation and Adoption) which serves as a safe haven for many companion animals and a learning resource for children and adults facilitating New Leash On Life\u2019s dream of making Los Angeles a no-kill city.\r\n\r\nWe've recently developed our Lend a Paw program, rescuing dogs from the shelter and training them as assistance and therapy dogs for people and children in need.  In addition to our Lend a Paw training program, we are implementing a training program for all of our rescues.  It is our goal to put each dog rescued from the shelter through an obedience training course prior to being placed for adoption.  A very select few may be chosen for Lend a Paw, while most will be adopted to loving families immediately.  By training each dog, the adoptive family has a better chance of developing a better bond and a permanent relationship.  In addition, our dogs get a lot of human attention from our training volunteers while they wait for their new home.\r\n\r\n","meetPets":"New Leash On Life Animal Rescue, visits by appointment only!","services":"adoptions, boarding, training social-therapy dogs","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

After filling out the application, please save or print and scan it and email to: adopt@caninecellmates.org. As soon as we have received your application, a member of our Adoption Coordination team will be in touch with you. Next, we would like for you to attend one of our meet n' greets to meet your potential new pup face to face (dates and times will be announced on our Events page). Lastly, we will conduct a home visit and introduction to your family (both human and non-human). Additionally, all of our dogs require an adoption fee.\r\n\r\nThe dogs in the Canine CellMates program are all selected from Fulton County Animal Control, a high-kill facility, which is now under the management of Lifeline Animal Project. Each dog chosen for the program undergoes extensive temperament testing to determine their suitability for the program. Under the supervision of volunteer professional trainers and assistants, the dogs and their handlers spend eight weeks learning basic obedience. Equally important, the dogs are socialized around a variety of people and other dogs during this period.\r\n\r\nCanine CellMates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 dogs are available for adoption immediately and will be able to go to their forever homes after graduation. Canine CellMates will carefully screen all adoption applications to ensure the right match between dog and person.\r\n\r\nLike all dogs adopted from FCAS, the Canine CellMates graduates are fully vaccinated, micro chipped, spayed or neutered and are on monthly heartworm prevention.","about":"Canine CellMates began in June 2013 as a dedicated jail dog program in cooperation with the Fulton County Jail in Atlanta, GA. Canine CellMates maintains a continuing partnership with the Fulton County Animal Services (FCAS), the Fulton County Sheriff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office and the Fulton County Jail, allowing us the opportunity to save dogs from the shelter by vetting them, training them and ultimately transforming them into adoptable dogs, all while benefiting the inmates and the greater community.\r\nOur Mission: Our mission is to provide a better life for both the inmates in the Fulton County Jail and rescued shelter dogs from FCAS. During an intensive 16 week course consisting of education, training and overall care for the dogs, we hope to positively change both the dogs and the inmates. During the 16 week program, an inmate is able to train two dogs, one after the other. At the end of the training course, our goal is for the dogs to pass the Canine Good Citizen test and graduate from our program into a wonderful, forever home. We also aim to provide viable job skills for the inmates and create a new overall lease on life for both the dogs and the inmates.\r\nWhat We Do: All of the dogs selected for our program have undergone extensive temperament testing with our dedicated Behavior Assessment team. Upon arrival at their temporary home in the dormitory style setting within Fulton County Jail, each dog is assigned a primary inmate handler, and on occasion, a secondary handler. This not only allows for more inmates to benefit from the program, it also provides continuity for the dog, should one of the handlers leave the program.\r\n\r\nCertified dog trainers and training assistants conduct the training sessions throughout the 16 week course, using positive training methods to teach the inmates how to train and care for the dogs. Outside of the work in the classroom, the inmates spend time during the day with their dog, bonding and reinforcing the skills learned in class. We also have a strong educational component to our program \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we bring speakers in to talk about issues such as Breed Specific Legislation, Tethering - the dangers and the alternatives, resources like Ahimsa House, and other professionals both inside and outside of the animal rescue community. A common theme is One Person Can Make a Difference. We truly believe that, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you know better, you do better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n\r\nWhy It Matters: In simple terms, this program changes lives \u00e2\u0080\u0093 both canine and human, by offering them a second chance at life. Both groups have faced isolation and rejection by the outside world, but when they come together, they often give each other a new found sense of hope, as they become the rescuer for one another.\r\n\r\nThe benefits to the inmate handlers are many, including: learning responsibility by caring for a living being, accountability in working towards a goal, experiencing the joy of unconditional love, gaining confidence in working toward a positive outcome and skills that will allow them to become law abiding, productive members of society.\r\n\r\nThe incidence of violent outbursts in prison and jail facilities where jail dog programs operate has shown a dramatic decrease, sometimes as much as 50%. Recidivism rates have also shown drastic improvements. The Atlanta metro area has had one of the highest recidivism rates in the country, around 70% within the first two years after release. With programs like this in place, it is likely that the Atlanta metro area will begin to show a reduction in this recidivism rate.\r\n\r\nAt FCAS, 30 to 40 animals in need are added each day to the already overcrowded shelter population. Unfortunately, due to a lack of space, many healthy, adoptable dogs are euthanized. At Canine CellMates, we work in conjunction with FCAS to lower this alarming statistic by providing community outreach, education and forever homes for the Canine CellMate dogs.","meetPets":"Meet n' greets.

After we have received the application and they interested party are sure of their choice we do either a home visit or a vet reference to make sure that it is in fact the right situation for the animal. If all goes well then the new adopter will be asked to sign an adoption agreement. This contract gives us the right to remove the animal if the adopter does not follow our required conditions. We then make a copy of their identification to put on file with their adoption application, agreement, and owner form. The adopter then pays the adoption fee. This fee ranges according to the type of pet and the gender of the pet. If the pet has not been spayed or neutered during it's time with us, or the pet is still too young to undergo the process the owner receives a spay and neuter voucher to redeem at the time of their appointment.

We do accept out of state applications as long as you are willing to travel to us to meet the dogs before a final adoption decision is made.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Kingdom!   \r\nWe would like to take a moment to introduce ourselves to you and your organization. After many months of planning and preparation, launched Royalty Dog Rescue, LLC on April 26th, 2013.  We are an all volunteer res- cue groups, located in beautiful Tuscarawas County, Ohio. We began as a small group formed to help save dogs in need, and have grown to over 20 fosters and almost 15 volunteers.  We do not have a facility - our pets for adoption are fostered, providing them with a sense of a home life while they wait for their forever home. We work with other rescues in the area by taking in some dogs when they are filled to capacity. Founded by dog lovers, who combined have over 40 years of rescue experience. We have thoroughly screened foster par- ents for the dogs in our program.       Our mission statement is, Royalty Dog Rescue saves dogs who have run out of time at dog pounds and brings people and animals together to enrich each others lives. Our goals include the rescue, rehabilitation, spay\/neuter and adoption of the abandoned dogs, as well public education regarding breeds and the im- portance of spay\/neuter of animals in battling the escalating overpopulation problem.    Royalty Dog Rescue, take dogs into our program from dog pounds, humane societies, surrendered by owners and from commercial breeders. We will never pay an individual or breeder for a dog.  All dogs are spayed\/neutered and receive complete vet care, before they can be adopted.         In compliance with State of Ohio law, we are a registered rescue, we are an Incorporated Non-profit and we are a registered 501c3 non-profit with the IRS.   We are solely run on donations, whether from adoptions, events or fundraisers.","adoptionProcess":"\u00e2\u0080\u00a2The first step in adopting from Royalty Dog Rescue is to fill out our adoption application, which can be found on our web site. \r\n\r\nOnce we receive that, we will call your personal references and your vet. Please make sure and let your vet know that we will be calling and give them permission to speak to us! Remember, we are a small all volunteer rescue, so it may sometimes take a week or two once we receive your application to call them. Please be patient with us during this process. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2The second step is that we arrange a meet and greet with the dog or dogs that you are interested in. Our adoption procedure includes having several meet and greet with our prince or princesses, along with their foster parents before an adoption is finalized. If you are willing to commit to these visits, we are more than willing to adopt to you and your family. Adopting a rescue dog is a long term commitment .We are not a facility, all of our dogs are in foster homes. The meet and greet will be held at one of our board members home. If you currently have pets in your home, you are more than welcome to bring them to this meeting.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2The third step in the process is that we will arrange for a home visit. We will bring the dog or dogs that you are interested to your home. \r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2The final step in the process is that the Royalty Dog Rescue Board members will meet and decide which kingdom is the best fit for our Royal and then the adoption will be finalized. We do require that you come to us for your final adoption also. \r\n\r\nSome important things to note:\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2It may take a week or two to arrange a meet and greet due to the foster families schedule. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2Our policy is NOT first come first serve, it is whomever is the best fit for the dog and sometimes the dog chooses for us! &#8203;\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2If a home visit is done more than 60 miles from Dover, Ohio, a $25.00 mileage fee will be added for each 60 miles, to the adoption donation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2YES!! We do adopt &#8203;out of state, but, you are required to come to us for the meet and greets and adoption. In the case of an out of state adoption, we utilize a rescue close to you to preform the home visit. If you are willing to make these trips, then we are willing to adopt out of state!

We do in-home support for unruly bullies to help them stay with thier forever families to help make that bond all the more stronger.  We work closely with our surrounding Animal Control facilities to save them from death row, and also work directly with the public on owner surrenders due to emergencies and family changes.  \r\nWe may not be able to take in every one, but we will try our hardest to help them all in any way we can! \r\nThe beginning of February started a chain of events that has brought all of us at Hernando's APBT Rescue to change the name.\r\nIn February, one of our dearest pits, Aztek, was adopted by Blue, who is now the co-director of the rescue. His love for Az is unprecedented. Recently, Blue quit his job to take the position and help as many of these wonderful dogs as he can.

This program started in 2010 with the Bath Institution Feral Cat Colony which was slated to be euthanized. Due to a successful and intense media campaign by S.N.K.I., this colony was saved, is now completely stabilized (all cats spayed\/neutered) and is being \u00e2\u0080\u009cmanaged\u00e2\u0080\u009d by one of the inmates. T\/N\/V\/R continues to be one of the mainstay programs of S.N.K.I. due to an overwhelming need for this service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.N.K.I. Today\r\n\r\nSpay Neuter Kingston Initiative continues to grow, branching out into different areas as the need arises.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Over 650 cats and kittens, and rising, have been fixed through our T\/N\/V\/R Program;\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cManaged\u00e2\u0080\u009d Feral Cat Colonies:  All colonies accepted into our T\/N\/V\/R Program must have a caretaker committed to providing food, water and adequate shelter for the duration of the lifetime of the colony. Food is supplemented by S.N.K.I. as donations permit;\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Cat Foster\/Adoption Program: (Kitty Connections) \u00e2\u0080\u009cFriendly\u00e2\u0080\u009d cats and kittens born into our \u00e2\u0080\u009cmanaged\u00e2\u0080\u009d feral cat colonies are brought into foster homes where they are socialized to people. Each cat or kitten is vetted, vaccinated, treated for internal and external parasites, spayed or neutered and microchipped prior to adoption. All homes are carefully screened and every effort is made to find the best possible \u00e2\u0080\u009cmatch\u00e2\u0080\u009d based on the needs of the animals in our care and those of the potential adoptive homes. To date we have placed over 100 cats and kittens from our colonies into their forever homes.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 K9 Connections: Originally a Dog Foster Adoption Program, K9 Connections focuses on keeping dogs in their homes utilizing available resources.\r\n- Meet Your Match: Second part of K9 Connections - Utilizing a questionnaire, matches individuals looking for a dog(s) with dogs from reputable dog rescue organizations and shelters.\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 S.N.K.I. was part of the City of Kingston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Responsible Pet Ownership Program Committee. A voucher system is being implemented in 2014, providing $25,000 ($100.00 vouchers) towards the cost of spaying\/neutering pets of low-income individuals.\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The City of Kingston approached S.N.K.I. in February of 2014 and asked us to implement the T\/N\/V\/R portion of the R.P.O.P. A total amount of $25,000 has been budgeted for the first year (2014) with funding available for spay\/neuter and vaccinations only. As S.N.K.I. is already running an effective T\/N\/V\/R Program, we are very much aware that there are other costs associated with optimal colony health. To that end, S.N.K.I. is covering all costs for flea treatment, treatment of minor injuries and major injuries (based on vet recommendation and as our funding permits) as well as any necessary testing. We will be recommending that these extra items be allocated for in the amount budgeted for next year.\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The City of Kingston has committed to explore the long-term vision of establishing a cost efficient, dedicated low-cost spay\/neuter clinic operated in partnership with animal welfare stakeholders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoverning Body\r\n\r\nOur governing body is our Board of Directors. The Board is responsible for setting long-term policy, establishing the strategic direction of S.N.K.I. and ensuring the effective use of overall resources. Ultimate responsibility for control and direction of S.N.K.I. is vested in and taken by the Board of Directors.","meetPets":"Facebook page; website; Petango (PetPoint System); adopt-a-pet.com","services":"T\/N\/V\/R; adoptions of kitties from colonies; dog retention and Meet Your Match (dog program)","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

The adoptive owner agrees to submit a DPMU Adoption Update Form on the animal(s) each year on or before the date of adoption until DPMU deems this is no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nAll animal(s) will go to the best\/most appropriate home that we feel meets the horses needs. Our fees are based on what it cost us to procure the animal and pay vet and shipping costs.\r\n\r\nAny animal adopted from DPMU may not be moved to a new location or leased or loaned to another person without prior approval from DPMU. DPMU also reserves the right of first refusal if for any reason the adoptive owner is unable or unwilling to maintain the animal properly.\r\n\r\nDreamchaser Horse Rescue & Rehabilitation cannot guarantee any animal(s) as to its disposition or training. Animals which come into our custody are usually young and untrained. Due to their usually debilitated condition, temperament generally changes with proper care. Dreamchaser Horse Rescue & Rehabilitation will include with each adoption a complete file on the animal(s), which will explain how the animal came to be on the farm, what veterinary care it received while it was here and what the staff has personally noticed about the animal's disposition and training.\r\n\r\nBecause certain homes that do not meet our preliminary criteria may qualify to adopt certain animals, please contact the office if you have any question about your eligibility.\r\n\r\nSee our website for application.","about":"Dreamchaser was initially created to rescue mares and foals that were discarded by the drug industry. Since our inception, we also rescue horses from feedlots, abuse, and abandonment. We have taken in many animals in the last several years. We have gentled and trained more than one hundred horses from the drug industry, and eighty horses from abuse, abandonment, and feedlots. The majority of our horses are totally wild (untouched by humans) when they arrive here. We are one of very few facilities that can gentle and train a wild horse - our secret is common sense, time, gentleness, and patience. On average, the length of time a rescued horse spends with us is one year.\r\n\r\nOur main goal is to rescue and\/or purchase these animals to give them housing, feeding, and gentling with the hope to place them into loving, permanent homes through our adoption program.","meetPets":"Daily at the ranch","services":"adoptions, rescue, and rehabilitation","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

The sad truth is some shelters have to euthanize 8\/10 dogs that come in simply because they do not have enough space. These dogs are sometimes housebroken, spayed\/neutered, good with dogs\/cats\/kids, and would have made perfect family pets.

During the day, they spend their time serving their country in the United States Air Force. \r\n\r\nWe started rescue in 2005 and have been saving lives ever since.  It takes a lot of hard work, dedication, and love but for the us, it is a family affair!  Our four young children share the same passion for animals and helping and we are blessed to have them sharing the experience!\r\n\r\nA LITTLE ABOUT For Belle's Sake Rescue & Rehab\r\nBELLE'S STORY\r\nBelle, a dog rescued by Christian and Shelby, sits in the field where she was found in Sumter S.C., April 1, 2012. Belle suffered alone in the field for five days; she was malnourished and had open wounds and fire ants across her body before the family rescued her. She died hours after being rescued. In honor of her, the couple started \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor Belle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sake Rescue and Rehabilitation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d an animal rescue, rehabilitation, adoption and pet watching service. \r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u008bIn honor of a particularly memorable rescue, a dog named Belle, Christian and Shelby started \"For Belle's Sake Rescue and Rehabilitation,\" an animal rescue, rehabilitation, adoption and pet watching service. Belle was a pit bull mix, or pibble. \r\n\r\nBelle passed away April 1, 2012, hours after being rescued. She died from complications resulting from maltreatment. When the Birds received a call to rescue her, she was in critical condition. They found her on the side of a road, malnourished, with open wounds and fire ants on her body. \"We got a phone call in the late afternoon about a dog who had been hit by a car,\" Shelby explained. \"A woman was at a stop sign, looked over into a grassy field and saw a head peering over the grass. So she walked out into the field and found Belle laying there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Belle couldn't stand and was surrounded by cans of dog food and chicken. She was covered in red ants, which had to have been very painful. We brought her home and set her up in a crate. When we carried her into the house, I flipped her over and her wounds were terrible,\" she continued. \"We immediately called an EMT to come evaluate her since the nearest after hours vet clinic was in Columbia at the time. It was then that I named her Belle.\"\r\n\r\n\"She had two shattered back legs, a broken back, all of the skin and muscle was missing from her hind legs from road rash, and she was in organ failure,\" Shelby explained \"We knew if we tried to save her, it would be a long and painful process and she more than likely would not survive it. She needed blood transfusions and both hind legs amputated. The EMT said she was in shock and her body was shutting down.\"\"He said her wounds appeared to be at least five days old,\" Shelby said. \"Meaning she suffered that duration alone in excruciating pain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Someone knew she was there because they were trying to feed her,\" she continued. \"But no one helped.\"\"The entire time he was evaluating her, her tail was wagging,\" she said. \"I knelt before her, held out my hands, and asked a very simple question. 'Belle, what do you want?'\"She rested her head in the palm of my hands and closed her eyes,\" she explained. \"Her breathing got slow and she told me she was ready to go.\"\r\nEverything we do, we do For Belle's Sake","meetPets":"Meet and greets are by appointment only after adoption application approval.

The application asks general questions related to pet ownership in order for us to get to know you and your family better.

We highly recommend bringing your existing furry family members to the first meeting as it is a great opportunity to make sure everyone will get a long. \r\nPlease note, most of our pets will require a home visit depending on certain circumstances and sometimes we work with other rescue partners in order to get this requirement fulfilled out of our local area.  Home visits are done in order to make sure your yard is secure and or to assist you with puppy proofing if you are adopting a puppy.  Also, if you rent your home, we require verification from your landlord that pets are allowed and the pet you are adopting is an acceptable pet to the property owner.\r\nOnce the application and home visit if applicable are completed, we will proceed to completing the Pet Adoption Agreement and collecting the adoption fee.  Keep in mind our adoptions fees vary so please inquire about our fees for each animal.\r\nHere at Mending Fences our job is to assist you with finding a family pet that will fit in with your family and life style in order to assure a positive, successful adoption and forever home for the animal.

Flight\r\ncosts, travel cages, pre-flight veterinary exams and export paperwork can run anywhere from\r\n$300 to $1000 depending on a number of variables (which airline, the absence or presence of a\r\nflight volunteer, the size of the dog, the size of the travel cage, whether any boarding is\r\nrequired during transit).\r\nWe feel it is important to outline these costs here, since although the low end is comparable to\r\nmany animal shelter and rescue adoption fees, the high end can potentially be prohibitive for\r\nsome adopters. We also feel it is imperative to point out that the remainder of the transit cost,\r\nleft over after what is paid for by you, must be funded by ISDF.\r\nAlthough some of our adoptable dogs have flights that have been paid for partially or even fully\r\nby ISDF fundraising efforts, there are always other costs involved with transport: extra\r\npaperwork, pet taxis, boarding at layover sites, cargo fees and taxes when we pick up the dogs\r\nat the airport - as well as fostering, feeding, and veterinary care costs spent prior to flying and\r\nafter flying, but before adoption.\r\nAdditionally, most of our dogs are not funded in full, despite our best efforts, so we must\r\nconstantly borrow against helping future dogs for fees outside what we fundraised. With this in\r\nmind, please understand that we suggest a minimum donation of $300, if at all possible (again,\r\nto reiterate, we would never want adoption costs to drive away potential adopters, so please\r\nknow this is a guideline for giving only) so that we may continue to help the maximum number\r\nof seriously needy dogs.\r\nWith no paid staff and no overhead costs, 100% of all donations from adoption fees and our\r\nfundraising efforts goes towards helping not only the dog you adopt, but all others going\r\nforward in future. The more ISDF must pay out per dog, the less we are able to help\r\nthe many others awaiting homes of their own.\r\nWe are happy to go over your particular dog's estimated costs in greater detail during the home\r\nvisit, should you have more questions - but at this time, we would like an idea of what you\r\nthink you would be able to cover.

Many wonderful dogs who are searching for their \u00e2\u0080\u009cforever family\u00e2\u0080\u009d never find one because they display undesirable, but easily corrected, behavioral challenges. Some dogs, because of abuse, neglect, inadequate training or no training at all, never learn the social skills they need to be good companion dogs. Through no fault of their own, they might behave aggressively, defensively or fearfully. Tragically, these dogs are then passed over by rescue organizations, not offered for adoption by shelters and then euthanized. This is a terrible loss, both for the dogs and for the many potential families who could have welcomed and loved such an animal. Training and rehabilitation for these dogs is an unmet need among most animal rescues and shelters. We seek to fill this need by raising money for these often invisible and forgotten dogs. At Training Rescue Dogs, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe in giving up on dogs; we believe in giving them the future.","meetPets":"By appointment with the foster or various adoption events","services":"training, adoptions","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

We consist of a group of volunteers who rescue animals, foster them in our homes and place them up for adoption.\r\nAlthough we are a non-profit corporation, in practicality, we are just a handful of dedicated animal-loving volunteers.  We all have jobs, families and busy lives, but we\u2019re all committed to saving animals.  Often we stay up nights bottle feeding kittens, or nursing sick or injured animals or making trips to the emergency vet.   \r\n\r\nSince we operate out of our own homes, our space is very limited so we limit our focus to rescuing animals in dire need.  During spring and summer, we have seasonal foster parents that help us during the busiest times, taking in litters of tiny sick kittens or pregnant momcats.   We always need more fosters so please contact us if you\u2019re interested in fostering!   Remember even Superman had foster parents.\r\nWe rescue many animals from euthanasia at overcrowded county shelters, as well as taking in orphans and homeless animals found by people on their property, or sadly abandoned in front of stores or on roadsides.   By taking these animals under our wing we alleviate shelter overcrowding and give these animals a chance at a good home.  We foster the animals in our homes, often nursing many of them back to health, then have them spayed\/neutered, microchipped, vaccinated & wormed before putting them up for adoption. \r\n","meetPets":"They are in foster homes, and we hold adoption events at Bennett Valley Pet store and Petco in Santa Rosa on weekends","services":"Animal Rescue","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Animal Rescue.  We have our paws in many projects for Southern Missouri Dogs.  In addition to our Foster Care Program for homeless dogs to seek adoption into forever homes, our sister site www.petfinder.com\/shelters\/MO207.html is our Safety Forum.  This site features dogs in our communities.  These dogs are not in foster care but remain in their original situation.  Ozark Haven is part of a huge network and often the dogs in the Safety Forum are seen by other rescues and find safety.  In our continued work with CARE, a Not for Profit Homeless Dog Transport we can offer SO MO dogs a chance to reach populations where they arent as common and have better adoption potential.  Dogs that live rurally in the forest communities of Southern Missouri dont have municipalities or other agencies to help them.  They often burden the hillsides and face horrible violent fates.  Our Safety Forum provides those dogs fair and equal web exposure to find safe screened options for life!!  \r\n\r\nOur Dominicks Honor program addresses the deadly practice of tethering.  People will tie anything around a dogs neck.  Our local rural administrations are not concerned with the deadly act of tethering.  As a charity we cannot lobby but we sure can offer light weight harnesses and cables to improve the life of dogs that are tethered.  While sharing the gift of painless tethering, we always offer our Safety Forum services in hopes of moving these dogs to a home with appropriate care practices.  \r\n\r\nOur Littering the Ozarks Program has been a successful one, we plan to build on this in the New Year.  We will offer screened placement of unwanted litters in the community if the owners of the mother will consent to allow us to spay her.  This program has been well received in our communities and is a targeted program for growth in 08.  \r\n\r\nAnd finally, our Feral Dog Project MO.  Feral dogs are a symptom of \"dumping\".  Abandonment plaques our communities.  With limited options for unwanted pets, dumping on a country road is common place.  The survivors of these dumpings often find disease, starvation, conficts with wildlife and violent deaths are their only reward.  The strongest survivors may be a natural enemy to fielded livestock, chickens or local small game such as rabbits and squirrels, at which time they become hunted themselves.  They threat our farmers and burden our food chain.  Feral Dog Project MO supports the use of humane trapping, rehabbing and placement of these dogs.  In the future we hope to build a compound for feral dogs that will not make human companions. Here they could continue to live \"wild\" but with safety and care.  These would be the exception as many is the time these lost terrified souls make wonderful pets!!

Every home and every companion animal has it 's own unique personality and requirements. We place our animals in the supportive and loving environment of home foster care. While there, we gain knowledge about their personality, training skills, likes and dislikes.\r\n\r\nTo assist us with matching the correct companion animal with the most appropriate and compatible home,please email us the answers to the below questions and any other information you think would be helpful. The emailed information may be followed-up by a Camp Papillon Adoption Coordinator, with a phone interview and then a home check.\r\n\r\nAdoption contract and post adoption follow-up checks are required as a condition of adoption. Some companion animals get multiple applicants or are not appropriate matches, so not all adoptions will be approved. Not all applicants will receive a yes or no response due to limited staff. We reserve the right to refuse any adoption without justification. \r\n\r\n\r\nOur Adoption Costs\r\nDogs: $250\r\nPuppies:$300\r\nPuppies $50 Refund after proof of spay\/neuter\r\nCats: $75\r\nKittens: $100\r\nKittens $25 Refund after proof of spay \/ neuter\r\nRabbits, Ferrets, etc: $25\r\n\r\nWhy the high cost? Can't I adopt an animal for less? No.. and here's why: Our animals come fully vetted. It costs us less for medical care then you due to non-profit discount. So if you adopt an animal for less it will cost you more later. Spay & Neutering your animals, along with keeping up on shots prevents disease & illnesses.\r\n","about":"Camp Papillon is a non-profit, no-kill 501c3 animal rescue group dedicated to giving all homeless animals a place to call home. All of our animals are currently housed in foster homes, we don't have an actual location for housing the animals we rescue. These foster families are made up of dedicated volunteers who open their homes to dogs, cats, rabbits and other animals that are in need of a place to live until they can be adopted.\r\n\r\nThis allows the fosters to evaluate the animals and determine how they interact with people, other dogs, cats, etc. so we can place them in their forever homes. In some cases, the animals are ready for adoption upon entering our rescue. Others need some training or have behavioral issues that need to be addressed before we put them up for adoption. Many shelters would have euthanized dogs that they deem unadoptable, but not us. The foster situation is the best way to be sure these animals are well socialized with people and, most times, with other animals. Camp Papillon covers ALL the costs associated with fostering our animals from vet care to food, toys, treats, etc. Our fosters just supply the love and affection to the animals they take in.\r\n","meetPets":"Check our website for our events.","services":"adoptions,rescue","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

We are an all-foster network committed to helping dogs and cats in need of homes. Individual donations are our most important source of income as we receive no public funding.\r\n\r\nOur purpose is to provide medical assistance, foster homes, and adoption services to previously lost, abandoned, abused, or neglected animals in Wake County, NC and the surrounding counties. Our mission is to educate this disposable society in which we live that every life should be valued and cherished and is directly linked to human responsibility and commitment.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the animals we rescue require immediate medical attention. BFPA never turns away or euthanizes an animal because of the expense involved in returning them to good health. All our rescued animals are evaluated for temperament, examined by a veterinarian, vaccinated, microchipped (if possible) and sterilized, if age appropriate. Cats and dogs receive monthly flea\/tick preventative and dogs also receive monthly heartworm preventative.\r\n\r\nThe most important ingredients we provide to these animals are loving care and a safe haven -- something most of them have never experienced. These cats and dogs live in volunteer foster homes until we find them a loving permanent home, however long it takes. We match these precious beings to a single, couple or family who understand cats and dogs should be full participating members of the family. Our hope is that these animals never have to experience being unloved again.\r\n\r\nSince our beginning, BFPA has rescued and placed over 2,500 cats and dogs into their forever homes.\r\n\r\nBFPA was created in 1998 by two Raleigh-area women who had volunteered with other established rescues in the Triangle. Their dedication to help homeless dogs and cats has led to an organization that has grown to over 225 volunteers strong.\r\n\r\nBFPA received 501(c)(3) status in 1999.","meetPets":"Because all of our animals are in foster homes (we do not have a shelter or any other official building), animals can be met at our adoption events or scheduled with fosters on an individual basis","services":"fostering, adoption, all animals are fully vetted before being adopted (including spay\/neuter)","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Usually, though, most owners in this situation turn their pets over to the county-run Animal Control facilities, and there is a 70 percent chance the dog will be euthanized.  An owner surrendered older dog or and cat, or poorly-socialized purebreds, mixed breeds, and sick or injured dogs are usually euthanized immediately. The others might be put up for adoption, but with so many animals coming in each day, often there is no room to keep even the healthy, adoptable ones for very long in these shelters.\r\n\r\nThis is where Perfect Pets Rescue, Inc. steps in. We rescue most of our dogs  from area shelters and once rescued, they are vaccinated, treated for intestinal and external parasites and are spayed or neutered. Sometimes, dogs need to get medical treatment beyond this.\r\n\r\nAll animals are fostered and get used to the \"good life\".  Eventually, every dog is placed in the kind of home where it will never again know the fear and pain it has lived with most, if not all, of its life.\r\n\r\nIn time, an amazing transformation occurs. Their emotional, physical and spiritual wounds heal.  Scared dogs are transformed into healthy, playful, affectionate pets. They learn to play.  They learn to trust. They learn to live without fear or confusion. They become the pets they were meant to be and live the lives they were meant to live. \r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that we are a small registered non-profit 501(c)(3) organization at this time, and can only rescue few dogs at a time. Volunteers willing to open their hearts and their homes to our rescue dogs are also crucial to our continued success.

Once an animal is placed from our rescue, the animal cannot be sold, given away or otherwise transferred. If the adopter is, at any time, unable to keep or continue to maintain the animal for any reason, the animal must be returned to the St. Mary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Animal Welfare League. \r\n\r\nWe work hard at matching our animals to adopters, so they may end their search for a loving, permanent home. Temperament, special needs and personality are all factors in our placements. \r\nStep #1 \r\nThe Adoption Application \r\nThe initial step in our adoption process is the Adoption Application. This can either be done online or in person. The Adoption form must be filled out completely including vet references and two personal non-family references. Your application will be reviewed and your references will be contacted. We contact your veterinarian to ensure that your current or recently deceased pets were properly taken care of---this means being current on all vaccinations and spayed or neutered. In order to speed up the process, please contact your veterinarian and let them know to expect our call. \r\nStep #2\r\nPersonal Interview You will be interviewed by a SMAWL Board Member or Volunteer either through phone, email or in person. This is an opportunity to learn more specifics about you, your family, your pets and the type of pet you are looking for. At this time, we may suggest that you consider a different animal---one that we may feel might be more acceptable for your situation. If you are completing your application in person, this will most likely be done at that time of completion.\r\nStep #3\r\nThe Home Visit If all goes well with the application verification, we will schedule a home visit. A home visit is required to ensure that your home is everything you say it is on the Adoption Application. It needs to be a suitable safe environment for your new pet. All pets and family members should be home at this time.\r\nStep #4\r\nMeeting Your Potential Adoptee Once the Application has been reviewed and all references checked, arrangements will be made for you to meet with the animal you wish to adopt, either through the foster parent or the animal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Case Manager. As a courtesy to our foster families, we do not ask them to show their animals to individuals until we have completed the application approval process. If you have other animals, we recommend a neutral meeting place, such as PETCO or a local park to ensure the animals are compatible outside of their own territory.\r\nStep #5\r\nFinalizing The Adoption Once the adoption has been approved, we will contact you to finalize the adoption. You will need to sign the contract and pay our adoption fee. (Dogs=$200, Young Cats 2 years and under =$125, Older Cats over 2 years = $75) \r\nFoster to adopt over a two week period may be available on a case by case basis.\r\nAny applications received for adoptions from beyond St Mary's county line, will be subject to additional terms and conditions available on request.\r\nPlease Remember: Our entire organization is staffed by volunteers. We have NO paid staff. Our volunteers must work your application around their business and personal lives. It may take as long as one week for you to hear from someone, but typically most applications are approved within 7-10 days.

Each dog or cat (or bunny) rescued from a shelter opens a cage and gives an opportunity to another pet to await a chance for adoption or rescue, thereby potentially saving yet another life.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are not always sure of the pedigree or background of each animal, those we place are generally well socialized family pets who came to the shelter through no fault of their own. We rescue kittens, puppies and bunnies as well as adult animals who deserve another chance for a loving home. We do not have a shelter or boarding facility, but instead rely upon foster homes to shelter and nurture our furry friends until a loving forever home is found. Our dogs and cats are all up to date with vaccines, and spayed or neutered. Dogs are microchipped and heartworm negative and cats have tested negative for FIV (if old enough) and FeLV.\r\n\r\nPlease look at our list of adoptables, and if you don't find one that seems right for you, or if you see one that is already flagged as adopted, please contact us at ggmcs@juno.com to let us know what you are looking for; perhaps we can help find the perfect match. We continually rescue new animals and will keep in mind specific requests from good homes.\r\n\r\nZani's Furry Friends is a volunteer organization which receives no funding or sponsorship. We depend on the generosity of those who are willing to donate time, supplies and money--and we are always in need of additional foster homes for either dogs or cats so that we may help free more animals from a dark fate at the shelter. Unfortunately our city's shelters face a continual space problem, and dozens of healthy, adoptable animals lose the race of time daily. If you are interested in opening your home and heart to foster one or more of our rescues, making a donation, or assisting with the myriad of details and chores that is involved in saving these precious lives, please contact us at ggmcs@juno.com for more information.

We are not yet a registered 501c3 rescue (but we are in the paper work process!) & we do not have a facility.

Our Board of Directors include: Our Founder & Executive Director Jessica Kratz, Pat Wilmsen is our Assistant Director, Matt Buleza  is our Treasurer & Catalina Ruiz is our Secretary. We also have the great honor and expertise of Robin Deltuva!\r\n\r\nWe help animals that are in dire and extreme situations such as: Running up and down high ways or living in sewer systems. We work in areas that are too dangerous for original TNR programs, such as beside highways, in the center of the city or in a building planed to be demolished. We go the extra mile that other people and groups wont. We have many years of experience with domestic, stray, feral, abused & abandoned pets. Also; small animals, farm animals and even experience wild animals and exotic animals. We are dedicated to bettering the lives of any animal that is unwanted or homeless. Through rescue, rehab, spay and neuter, and  adoption; we strive to lessen the number of animals that suffer from abuse and neglect. We treat every and any animal as family from the moment it comes in to our care and forever more. Any Animal once rescued by us is welcome back any time later in the future no matter what.\r\n\r\nASHA is NOT YET a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit Animal Rescue Organization and does not receive funding from the county, state or federal government.

Donate online today  via PayPalor send a check!\r\n\r\nI began helping the homeless animals in my little corner of the world in about 2000; Just an animal here, an animal there. Then as word began to spread, by 2002 my family and I had begun to made a name for our selves; \"the family that helps rescue animals.\" And as things happen, our weekend projects became our every day chores. We started rescuing more cats more frequently. Unfortunately there are more animals needing rescuing then there are families looking to adopt! Since we started in 2000 we have helped rescue and successfully re-homed over 650 animals!\r\n\r\nWe care about the animals because it is not their fault they are in the situation they are in, its never their fault. And because we are in a position where we can create a positive impact on their life we feel we must do all that we can. Stray and feral kittens and young cats that are caught and rescued are typically scared, aggressive and un-socialized at first. Thus; many places and people would deem them \"un-adoptable\" and would euthanize them on the spot, or send them back to the awful situation they came from.  We do not. We believe that with time, patience and love they are able to be rehabbed and eventually learn to trust humans. Some cats may take just days, others weeks or even months. Their options are limited if they do not shown that they can co-habitat with people; So we work hard to find the perfect forever family for each rescued animal. So we will do what we can, as often as we can to help the animals that are in need of us.\r\n\r\n                Animal Safe Haven and Adoptions, Inc. works to help rescue as many stray, feral, abandoned, homeless and abused animals from our community, the cities and the counties; as possible.

Each person in the group has adopted\/rescued animals and know the importance of giving animals that SECOND CHANCE in life. The founder has been in organized rescue for 8 years, but has been finding, rescuing and placing dogs in new homes since she was a young girl and has rescued over 200 dogs.\r\n\r\nOur animals at a minimum come spayed\/neutered, all shots up to date, microchipped and heartworm tested.  Our foster homes are not just a warehouse scenario.  Our dogs get worked with, trained and many times take months of rehab for the time we have them in our homes.  Adoption fees range from $150-250 and cats from $100-150.\r\n\r\nThe rescue was named after Jack, a Karelian Bear Dog that was rescued from a horrific situation at a rural ranch where he was abandoned to die.  He had been severely abused mentally and physically and had a shattered hind leg that had healed on its own in a frozen position.  Only one person, his new mom, was able to touch Jack for the first 4 months and only after she was able to gain his trust and show that a relationship with people could be one of trust, respect and love not fear and abuse.  He resembled a \"normal\" dog after about a year of rehab.  Now, eight years later, at the age of 9, Jack and his doggie sibings have helped rehabilitate a vast number of pups needing their SECOND CHANCE.  And he just recently got a prosthetic for his injured leg as he needs help as he has gotten older.  \r\n\r\nSecond Chance Jack is a small, all volunteer organization and our dogs are in foster homes and sometimes boarded when we have an animal in desperate need but no foster available.  We do need volunteers for foster homes as well as fundraising.\r\n","meetPets":"Our pets are in foster homes and  we arrange a visit once we have an approved.

Having volunteered for several other animal rescue organizations, Shannon saw a need to help the dogs and cats often overlooked by other rescuers, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnderdogs\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n\r\nOur very first rescues included a pair of black kittens named Fenway & Wrigley, a pitbull puppy named Lucy and a tiny Toy Poodle named Lily (who was suffering from a head injury). No other rescue groups would take Fenway or Wrigley because black kittens are often overlooked by potential adopters, and, up until the time we rescued Lucy, rescue groups had not been allowed to rescue any dog considered to be a \u00e2\u0080\u009cPit Bull\u00e2\u0080\u009d from Minneapolis Animal Control.\r\n\r\nWhile in law school, Shannon McKenzie had the \u00e2\u0080\u009canti-pitbull\u00e2\u0080\u009d policy changed, with the assistance of Attorney, Marshall Tannick. Underdog Rescue continues to successfully rescue and place pitbulls and other \u00e2\u0080\u009cbully-breeds\u00e2\u0080\u009d through a continued partnership with Minneapolis Animal Control.\r\n\r\nShannon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dedication to the Underdog also extends to puppy mill survivors. Dogs that survive life in a puppy mill often come with a different set of challenges. They may require additional medical care, socialization and teaching of basic dog skills even though some may be adults. Our volunteers understand this and welcome these pets into their homes to show them what life as a dog and life with kind humans is like.\r\n\r\n","meetPets":"All pets are available for meet and greets outside of adoption events.\r\nSee our website for adoption event locations.","services":"Adoptions","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

It typically takes about two weeks to complete the process and see if you are approved to adopt from us.\r\n\r\nWe realize our process seems like a lot to go through to adopt but we want to ensure when an adoption is made it is the best home possible for the dog and that the adopter is equally as happy. Most importantly we want the adoption to be successful and permanent!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.       Complete our online application. There is a $10.00 non-refundable application fee that will go toward administrative costs. Please note that an application does not lock you into adopting the dog you apply for. We do our best to accommodate you, however, because of timing; there may be another applicant ahead of you that is an appropriate match for the same dog.\r\n\r\n2.       Reference Checks. We DO call your references AND your Vet (if you have one). Please be sure to advise your vet and your references we will be calling. The biggest delay in processing your application is often veterinary offices or personal references NOT calling us back promptly.\r\n\r\n3.       Phone Interview. Shortly after you submit your application, one of our volunteers will call you to review your application and ask a few more questions.\r\n\r\n4.       Home Visit. Once all the references are completed, we will conduct a home visit. This is so we can know get to know you better and the environment the dog will be living in. We require ALL members of the household who will be interacting with the dog to be present when we visit.\r\n\r\n5.       Matching you with the right dog. Even during the process, we keep in mind all our available dogs and any preferences you indicated on your application. While you can tell us which one you would like to meet, we will let you know about all the dogs that we think would flourish in your home.\r\n\r\nMeet and Greets. This is when you meet the dog or dogs. It may be at the foster home, your home or another location that is convenient for everyone. If there is a dog already in the home we typically require two meetings. First one outside of your home and the second at your home.\r\n\r\nYou will sign our adoption contract, make your tax deductible donation and you can bring your new family member home!\r\n\r\nWhy is your process so rigorous?\r\n\r\nWhen we accept a German Shepherd into our rescue, we make a commitment to him or her, to care for them, get them healthy again and find them a permanent, loving home. We want to make sure that our applicants understand the lifetime commitment they are making and that they can provide our dogs a great new life.\r\n\r\nAdoption Requirements\r\n\r\nThe adopter must be between the ages of 21 and 76 years of age.\r\n\r\nIf you rent, you must ensure that your landlord allows large breed dogs to live in the apartment or home and show proof of the consent.\r\n\r\nWe require our adopters to attend professional obedience training with their adopted dog.\r\n\r\nAll animals currently living in the home must be up-to-date on vaccinations unless there is a medical reason\r\n\r\nOur adoption fees are as follows:\r\n$350 for puppies up to 1 year of age\r\n$275 for a dog from 1 to 7 years of age\r\n$150 for a dog 7 years or older\r\n\r\nWe will require a $150 refundable spay\/neuter deposit for any unaltered dog that is adopted out.

The group\u00e2\u0080\u0099s founders and members have years of experience with German Shepherds, bringing in depth understanding in evaluating and rehoming this highly intelligent breed. Our membership is completely volunteer and virtual, in that we do not have offices or a kennel facility but work entirely out of our homes and use foster homes to house dogs in our program while they await their new pack leaders.\r\n\r\nWe refer to our rescue activities as a program. There are very in depth evaluations of both dogs and applicants looking to adopt or foster. Before a dog is accepted into our program we conduct an extensive temperament test with the dog to see if it is shows aggression or displays many signals that they would become aggressive. For the safety of our members and adopters we do not accept any aggressive dogs into our program, which is the most difficult thing we must do at times. The dogs entering our rescue program may be from shelters, owner surrenders or owners in our Owner Rehoming Assistance Program. Similarly, with our applicants there is a detailed application process for us to understand the applicant, their family and the environment they may provide for one of our dogs.","meetPets":"Only potential adopters can meet our dogs. After they have gone through the adoption process and are approved we set up a meet and greet with the dog. Then if it goes well, a second meet and greet is scheduled at the home of the adopter.

All dogs and cats are fully vaccinated, treated for parasites and spayed or neutered. Many require additional care for heartworms, broken bones, mange and other diseases\/conditions. While many rescue groups turn away sick animals, APRA believes every good pet deserves a second chance. \r\n\r\nAside from providing the basics of food, water and shelter, APRA creates an enriching environment with social interaction and mental stimulation. Dogs spend their days in communal pens outfitted with beds, blankets and toys. Doggie doors allow them access to the yard. Cats are comfortably housed in their own room with scratching posts, ledges, bedding and toys. Volunteers walk the dogs, provide affection and teach basic training. Fosters take animals requiring additional attention into their homes. \r\n\r\nAPRA believes in the importance of community programs. The partnership with the SHARE Initiative allows returning soldiers with PTSS and brain injuries to learn new skills at the shelter like dog training and veterinary technology. With CHRIS Kids, at-risk children in foster care come to the shelter to train dogs. In doing so, they improve their listening skills and ability to follow directions while learning about humane animal care and the power of positive reinforcement. Pet Pals takes dogs and cats into nursing homes, bringing smiles to the elderly and reminding them they are not forgotten. \r\n\r\nWhen you help Atlanta Pet Rescue & Adoption, you are making a significant contribution in the lives of homeless pets, the families that will adopt them and the public at large.

If kittens are adopted before 12 weeks adopter is responsible for 2nd distemper shot.","about":"The Mt. Olive TNR Project is a grassroots effort to manage the feral cat population in Mt. Olive through Trap-Neuter-Return, a humane and effective solution to feral cat overpopulation. \r\n\r\nWhy this program is needed:  For years, the Township of Mt. Olive tried to control its feral cat population via the \u201ctrap and kill\u201d method, with animal control responding to complaints by trapping some of the cats, boarding them for the legally required 7 days, and then euthanizing them. In 2008, Mt. Olive impounded 181 cats and killed 141 of them, at an expense to the town of almost $20,000. Untrapped cats continue to reproduce, continuing the cycle of birth and extermination. \r\n\r\nHow TNR works: Trap-Neuter-Return is a humane method of feral cat management. All of the cats in an area are trapped, friendly adults and kittens who can be socialized are removed for fostering and adoption, and the remaining adults are spayed or neutered, vaccinated, and returned to their habitat for lifelong care. TNR is effective because it reduces feral cat numbers right away by removing kittens and friendly adults and because it stops the cycle of reproduction. Neutering also stops most nuisance behaviors, such as spraying, fighting, roaming, and caterwauling. TNR is affordable because low-cost spay\/neuter clinics perform the neuters and vaccinations as steeply discounted prices. TNR is approved by the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services, Morris County, the National Animal Control Association, the Humane Society of the United States, the ASPCA, the NJSPCA, and many other agencies and organizations.\r\n\r\nThe Mt. Olive TNR Project: The Mt. Olive TNR Project consists of residents who volunteer their time. The Project\u2019s volunteers do all aspects of the TNR Project, from outreach to trapping, transport, post-operative care, long-term oversight of cats and caregivers, and fostering and adoptions. We get cats neutered, vaccinated against rabies and distemper, ear tipped for identification (the universal sign of a TNR\u2019d cat, where the tip of the left ear is removed during the neuter surgery), and micro chipped.  Our project includes three residents who are certified animal control officers.\r\n","meetPets":"People can contact us to make appointments to visit our adoptable cats\/kittens in our foster homes and our kennel.

Once the home visit is completed and the adopter is approved, the adopter's info goes into a database where they are matched to the rescue dog most appropriate for their lifestyle and wants. Once the adopter and foster come to a mutual decision for adoption, the fees are collected and the adopter receives all medical and vaccination information.   ","about":"ALGBR is dedicated to educating the public on the breeds we rescue. We participate in both public and private events; educate school children and the general public. We are a non-profit* organization that is run solely on donations and all of our \u00e2\u0080\u009cemployees\u00e2\u0080\u009d are unpaid volunteers. We do this because we love these wonderful creatures and we want to place as many as we can into their forever homes.\r\nOur dogs come from several sources. First and foremost from owner turn-ins, these are dogs whose owners can no longer care for them. We take the dog into our organization rather than having the dog turned over to the Humane Society or Animal Care and Control. There is great value bringing these dogs into our program. They are less likely to be exposed to disease or suffer mental stress by moving from a home situation to a smaller program such as ours. The transition for the dog to the new home is much easier. Owner turn-ins also allow us to have a more complete history of the dog. We participate in the Maricopa County Animal Care & Control New Hope Program. The program allows us to intake dogs that are slated to be euthanized, often for no other reason than a lack of space. In addition, we work with other rescue groups who may not have room for a specific dog.\r\n\r\nOnce we intake a dog it usually will spend time in a foster home. Our foster homes are all volunteers that care for their foster dogs as if they were their own. This includes working on housebreaking, basic training, grooming and medical care. All dogs available for adoption have had a basic veterinary checkup, have current vaccinations and a micro chip.\r\n","meetPets":"Our organization is foster-based.

Please read all items carefully. If you are interested in adopting any of our dogs, please fill out the form at the bottom of every page. Thank you!\r\n\r\nDesigner Dog Rescue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal is to place homeless dogs into loving homes and families. We take special care to match the right home with the right dog, ensuring a lifetime of love for both the pet and the adopter. To ensure the best matches are made, we have a process that has been proven effective in determining the best homes for our animals. Our adoption process may seem time consuming or unnecessarily complicated, but please understand that we have our dogs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 best interests at heart. We strive to find the best homes possible for our dogs, as well as find the right dog for you and your lifestyle.\r\n\r\nPlease understand that our organization is completely run by unpaid volunteers, who dedicate their free time to help the dogs.  We thank you for your time and patience throughout our adoption process.\r\nStep 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Fill out a Adoption Application\r\n\r\nThe first step is to have you fill out a adoption application. This application will tell us about you and your lifestyle, training beliefs and background with animals.\r\nStep 2 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Application Preliminary Review\r\n\r\nOur application review volunteers will initially screen your application to determine if all necessary information was provided. If not you will be contacted to either fill out another application or provide additional information.\r\nStep 3 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Landlord Approval Verified\r\n\r\nIf it is determined that you rent your home, your landlord will be contacted to make sure you have approval to have a dog in your home. We also ask about any breed or size limitations.\r\n\r\nIf your landlord does not allow for a dog in your home, your application will be denied at this point in the process.\r\nStep 4 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Veterinary References Contacted\r\n\r\nOur volunteers will contact the veterinary reference(s) you provided to determine if all your current pets are spayed\/neutered and up to date on vaccinations. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any current pets, we will ask about the veterinary care that your previous pets received. If you have never owned a pet, this step is skipped.\r\nStep 5 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Home Visit and Applicant Interview\r\n\r\nOur organization requires home visits to determine that the dog will be living in a safe environment. This is an informal chance for us to get to\r\nknow you, your lifestyle, home environment and determine which dog(s) in our program might be the best fit. The home visit volunteer will do a short walk-through of your home and yard to ensure its safety and to advise on any areas of concern. All household members must be present for the home visit.\r\n\r\nIf our home visit volunteers have any major concerns about your home environment, or if you refuse a home visit, your application will be denied at this point in the process.\r\n\r\nDistance is a factor in whether or not the required home visit can be completed. We are a 100% volunteer run organization. Although we do have volunteer contacts in many areas, some areas may be difficult for us to locate a volunteer to conduct the home visit. We will let you know ASAP if your application needs to be denied due to our inability to find a volunteer to conduct the home visit. You can also contact a rescue close to your area to do a home check.\r\n\r\nWe do not Adopt out of California!\r\nStep 6 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Meeting between Approved Applicant & Available Dogs\r\n\r\nOur organization does not have a shelter where the dogs can be visited. Our dogs are in foster homes. We do NOT arrange meetings between interested individuals and our fosters until an applicant has been approved via this adoption process.\r\n\r\nOnce you have been approved, a volunteer (usually the foster) will contact you about scheduling a time for you to meet the dog(s) you are interested in. This meeting may occur at the foster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s residence or your home.\r\n\r\nJust because you are determined to be an approved adopter, you are NOT guaranteed a particular dog. For some dogs we receive many applications so we may allow multiple applicants to have a meeting with the dog before we choose the home that we feel will be the best fit for the dog. Also, if the volunteer involved in the meeting with you and the dog, does not feel you are a good fit for the dog, you may be denied adoption of that particular dog but you may be allowed to adopt another dog.\r\nStep 7 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Adoption Trial Period\r\n\r\nIf you have decided upon a dog that you would like to adopt, the adoption trial period (two weeks) can begin. At the start of the trial you are required to sign an adoption contract and to provide payment of the adoption donation fee. Checks received will not be cashed until the adoption has been made official.\r\n\r\nIf needed, our organization can provide a kennel\/crate, food\/water bowls, leash and collar for you to use during the trial period. We may also provide a small supply of dog food that will allow you to transition the dogs diet to another food.\r\n\r\nIf at any time during the trial period you are having issues with the dog, email or call and inform us. A volunteer will be in touch with you asap.\r\nStep 8 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Adoption Official\r\n\r\nIf, at the end of the two week trial, our organization has NOT heard from you, our organization will consider the adoption official. Your adoption donation fee will be deposited and will no longer be refundable. We will also mail out to you all veterinary paperwork we have for the dog.\r\n","about":"We are a small scale dog rescue located in Los Angeles dedicated to saving \u00e2\u0080\u009cdesigner breed dogs\u00e2\u0080\u009d, also known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cmutts\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the Los Angeles shelter system.

If you find a pet you wish to adopt, our adoption coordinators will talk with you to help make this adoption a perfect match for you and the pet.\r\n\r\n  Another benefit for visiting in person is that animals and adopters frequently have a special relationship that starts the very first time they meet.

That frequently has absolutely nothing to do with the looks or breed of the animal.\r\n\r\n When you adopt an AWL pet, you will have an animal that has been checked by our veterinarians, spayed or neutered, given basic shots (including Rabies),  a folder with the medical history and various useful information, and someone to answer any questions you might have. \r\n\r\n   We will ask you to promise that, if for any reason it does not work out, that you will bring the animal back to us.

All Bloodhounds in our care are spayed\/neutered, heartworm tested, administered heartworm prevention, brought up to date on vaccinations and provided any necessary medical care.\r\nThey are placed in foster homes where their temperaments, personalities and needs are evaluated so that we can find the best possible match between each individual Bloodhound and their adoptive family. \r\nAlthough the goal for all our adoptions is a lifetime commitment, we understand that sometimes circumstances beyond anyone\u0092s control occur.  OBR is committed to each Bloodhound for the remainder of their life and if, at any time and for any reason, the adoption does not work out, we require that the Bloodhound be returned to Ontario Bloodhound Rescue. \r\nWhy Do Bloodhound Need Rescuing?\r\nBloodhounds enter into our care for a variety of reasons, generally through no fault of their own, rather a change in their owner\u0092s life, such as divorce, new child, allergies, no time to dedicate to the care of the family dog, relocation, new job\/longer hours, just to name a few.\r\nIn today\u0092s throw-away society, some people are just not committed to the lifetime responsibility of adding a dog to their family.  At times the financial responsibility of adding a dog to their family was not taken into account.\r\nBloodhounds are a breed with many positive traits and attributes.  For those that love the breed, there is no other breed comparable.

We are not in the business of selling pets and as such we are not a cash and carry rescue.  When we refer to a \"fur\u2665ever home\" we expect a lifelong commitment to the adoptive dog you have chosen to adopt.  Our adoption process is designed to help carefully match a pet with both your lifestyle and well as their individual needs in mind.  This can take some time, but using this method has produced a high success rate of happy adoptions.    Our goal is to have this be a happy and certainly the final happy home for our sheltie.    \r\n\r\nAdopting a New Companion\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff  \r\n\r\nIf you are applying for one of our dogs from out of state, please note that we  DO NOT SHIP OUR DOGS.  If you are truly interested in adopting from Sheltie Shack Rescue you must be willing to make the trip to meet us and your potential new family member.  We expect the entire family to come, including any other current canine companions, as there is no other way to assure compatibility of all family members.  We have had many successful out of state adoptions and encourage you to apply if you can comply with these travel requirements.  We do not place our dogs in homes where current pets are not properly vaccinated, not on heartworm preventative or not  spayed or neutered unless there is a medical reason for not doing so or the dog is actively being shown in conformation.  We only place dogs in homes where they will be indoor pets and never left outdoors when no one is home.  For all puppies and nearly all of our adult dogs, a fenced yard is required.  On occasion we may have a well socialized, leash trained adult or senior sheltie that will do fine in a condo\/town house\/apartment environment where a responsible adopter will agree that all outside activities will ONLY take place on a leash.  This such determination will be made on a case by case basis.  We do NOT approve of electric\/invisible fences, dog runs or tie out chains.  Shelties adopted from us must be kept on heartworm preventative (Interceptor, no Ivermectin based products).\r\n\r\nHow to Submit an Application \r\n \r\n\u2022Apply online\r\n  \r\n\u2022Download an application (MS Word)\r\n  \r\n\u2022We will review the application, and will contact you by phone and\/or e-mail with any questions we might have.  If your written application is approved, a home visit will be scheduled next.  Since we often have volunteers do our home visits, we will contact you after getting their report and let you know if you've been approved to come meet the dog(s) of interest and hopefully adopt your next family companion.  If your application is not approved upon initial submittal, we will let you know within the next 24 hours or if at any time during the adoption process we feel you are not a good fit for the dog you are interested in, for whatever reason, you will also be notified per phone or e-mail. \r\n \r\n\u2022Adoption fees cover the spay\/neuter surgery, vaccinations, heart worm testing (treatment if necessary), dentals (when necessary) and worming. Other medical needs are addressed on a per need basis of each individual dog.  You will find that our fee is considerably less expensive than going to the vet yourself with a newly purchased dog from a breeder because our vets support rescue and provide reduced rates for their services.  Although we ask for a minimum adoption fee, we are always appreciative of any additional donation that helps defray costs such as travel expenses, food, bedding, toys and grooming services that are not factored into the adoption fee as well as set monthly operational expenditures.  \r\n\r\n\u2022An Adoption Contract for each dog will be signed as the last step of the adoption process. The contract is a binding and legal document that provides for returning the dog to Sheltie Shack Rescue if the adopter is no longer able to keep dog and allows for quick reclaim if there is abuse; the animal is found roaming free; or the dog is suffering from neglect.  You can expect a follow up inquiry as to how the adopted dog is doing and, hopefully, you would like to share your success story with us to post on the web.    \r\n\r\nWhere To See Our Dogs  \r\n\r\n\r\nSince we do not operate a shelter facility, only approved applicants will be invited to come and meet the dog(s) they are interested in and approved to adopt.  Since not all dogs are located at the same foster home, arrangements will be made on an individual bases as to where this meeting will take place and where the adoption will be completed.\r\n","about":"OUR MISSION as a small, totally volunteer nonprofit group, who give of their time, ability and even their homes is to provide for the rescue, care and placement of shelties who have been abandoned, neglected and\/or given up by their owners for various reasons.

Foster families will carefully evaluate each dog for behavioral characteristics, which will assist in a successful placement, education for each owner will cover, but not limit itself to, feeding and grooming needs, helpful training techniques and detailed instruction on how to assist the dog with adjusting to it\u2019s new home.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOUR PROMISE is to find adoptive homes that are carefully screened to ensure the best possible match, choosing a forever family willing to provide the dog with sufficient amounts of love, attention and interaction and where they can live out their lives without fear of further abuse or neglect.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOUR GOAL is the prevention of cruelty to Shelties everywhere, with emphasis first and foremost in our own state; to educate and inform the public regarding commercial breeding facilities (puppy mills) and why the public should never purchase a puppy from a pet store, the prevention of over-breeding and our utmost goal being the placement of rescued Shelties that find their way into our hearts and homes, into loving \u201cForever Homes\u201d of their own.\r\n","meetPets":"SEE ABOVE, adoption process.","services":"Complete medical needs.

Through education and volunteer programs, we promote community awareness of pet over population and responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe Haven is a non-profit sanctuary for animals that will be cared for regardless of how long it takes to find them loving homes.\r\n\r\nWHAT WE DO\r\n\r\n  The Haven was the idea and dream of Dr. Teresa Marshall, a local veterinarian, who ran The Haven out of her clinic for eleven years. In 2001 The Haven became a 501 (c) 3 non- profit organization. Also in 2001, the City of Fairhope offered use of part of the city animal shelter in return for The Haven providing veterinary care and staffing for the entire shelter. With this agreement both our need and ability to find homes for animals increased.\r\n\r\n  Many of the animals at The Haven have been neglected, starved, struck by cars, beaten, and\/or otherwise abused so the veterinary care and rehabilitation is frequently extensive and expensive. All of the animals are spayed or neutered and receive all necessary veterinary care such as de-worming, vaccinations, heartworm testing, micro-chipped, feline aids and leukemia testing, and receive 30 days of FREE pet health insurance. Potential adopters are carefully screened. Current adoption fees are $ 55 for cats and $80 for dogs. We are a no kill shelter so no adoptable animal is euthanized just because we don't find it a ready home- we just keep trying. Also we ask that if any home situation\/adoption does not work out for a Haven graduate, that the Haven be contacted so that we can find them the right home. We have the motto \"once a Haven animal, always a Haven animal\". We have frequent off -site pet adoption events, website marketing and other active marketing, as well as adoptions at the shelter - all in an effort to place animals. \r\n\r\n  Another important role The Haven plays is educating the community on the importance of spaying and neutering their pets. Our quarterly newsletter is distributed conatinaing updates from families that have recently adopted a companion for The Haven and many other pet related articles. We also have educational programs and information encouraging the humane care of animals- such as warning of the dangers of leaving pets in hot cars. We are becoming involved in the school system and discussing these issues with the children.   \r\n\r\nThe Haven would not exist though without all the tireless work of its many volunteers. Volunteers tasks are near endless including office support, walking dogs, helping at adoption and fundraising events, and, yes, cleaning cages. The Haven does various fundraisers through out the year to raise money for operations. Recent events have included a pet photo contest, a pet essay contest, a benefit luncheon featuring Fannie Flagg, and a pet Mardi Gras parade. The Haven also operates a resale shop of donated items with the proceeds benefiting The Haven. The resale shop also provides a volunteer opportunity for people who prefer not to work at the shelter itself.\r\n\r\n  The Haven is a relatively new organization that has made great strides in a short amount of time. We are proud of what we have accomplished, but we have a long way to go. We are striving to live in a society where loving, adoptable animals are not being killed. We need to change the mindset of our community that animals are disposable. \r\n\r\n  We appreciate your interest and if you have further questions feel free to contact us at (251) 929-3980, or at thehaven4animals@yahoo.com . Mail may be sent to P.O. Box 1063 Fairhope, AL 36533 .You may visit us at the shelter at 559 South Section Street in Fairhope, Ala.

My name is Kimbra Hill, President and Founder of Angel\u2019s Dog Rescue and Adoption, Inc.  I have been blessed to be able to pursue two of my life\u2019s dreams and passions\u2026hairstylist and working with abused, unwanted, and unloved dogs.\r\n\r\nJust recently, I\u2019ve been able to put a hold on my hairstyling career at Fresh Salon, (which is staffed with an awesome group of stylists), and begin my dog rescue.  I have been a hair stylist for twenty years and have always enjoyed making people more beautiful.  It was extremely difficult leaving my co-workers and my loyal and wonderful clients but they are very excited about my new adventure and supportive of my new career.\r\n\r\nI have a wonderful husband, Wes, and two precious children, Rain and Slate, who are my heart and soul.  If not for them, for their patience and support, this dream would never have become a reality for me.  \r\n\r\nNow, about Angel\u2019s Dog Rescue and Adoption!  All my life I have had a super soft spot for animals of all kinds but especially dogs.  I have always been drawn to them and it seems they are drawn to me as well.  I have found as many dogs as have found me.  My goal here at the rescue is to get unwanted dogs from animal shelters and (1) prevent them from being euthanized, (2) find the perfect home for these precious animals, (3) provide training for behavior problems, (4) make sure they are properly vetted before going to their new home, and (5) provide a loving environment for pets whose owners can no longer take care of them until a new home can be found.  Because of today\u2019s economy, there are so many families who are no longer able to provide for their pets and the owners may feel they need to surrender their pet to a shelter or even put them out on the street and I would like to be an alternative for them.  \r\n\r\nAnother goal is to stop the puppy mills!  People purchase \u201cpurebreds\u201d from pet stores, usually at a high cost, expecting their pet to be healthy and well taken care of.  Instead, because of puppy mills that sell to pet stores, many times these pets are inbred, not taken care of, and come from \u201cparents\u201d whose only purpose is to be bred over and over\u2026living their entire life in a small pen then, when no longer able to produce, their job being \u201cdone\u201d, they are killed.\r\n\r\nAngel, the namesake of our rescue, is an example of being an abused, unloved, unwanted, and overbred pet.  She had many issues when I rescued her and by showering her with lots of love, patience, and guidance, she is now a beautiful, well loved, and well behaved young lady who even has her own dog rescue!  To make the family complete, Angel is a sister to two other young ladies, two handsome young men, the mother of one handsome boy, and a foster sister to one beautiful young lady who still needs a wonderful home.  This makes my family complete and this rescue is my dream come true.  Thank you for taking the time to find out more about Angel\u2019s Rescue and Adoption.  Come back and visit anytime and look for updates.  Remember, a dog in need is a friend indeed.  \r\n\r\n\r\n","meetPets":"By appointment only","services":"Rescueing dogs from kill shelters, stray surrenders, owner surrenders, any that are in need of help!","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

We pull and re-home dogs from death row in the NY ACC shelters as well as from the Northeastern states where we have fosters, and from NC, SC and Georgia gassing shelters. \r\n\r\nWe all have the hope that one day we will be a no kill nation. Until then, we rescue as many dogs as we can, get them medical treatment and put them into foster homes until permanent homes can be found. We take in healthy dogs, mange dogs ,heart-worm positive dogs and dogs who have been abused or have broken bones and open wounds. When we are done, only the scars remain, and the beautiful animals underneath shine through. \r\n\r\nThe potential is there, for dogs to get a second chance at life, to know what love feels like.

WE DO NOT ACCEPT STRAYS \r\n\r\nHistory\r\nPet Pal Animal Shelter, formerly known as Pet Pal Rescue, was founded in the early 1980\u00e2\u0080\u00b2s by two women when they realized the high number of animals that were being euthanized due to pet overpopulation and neglect. Driven by their desire to make a difference, they began taking animals from shelters, and finding permanent homes for them. By 1988, they organized Pet Pal Rescue as a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization. Pet Pal Rescue was located in the Orlando area until August 2002. when it moved to Pinellas County, under the supervision of former director, Jennifer Forlizzo McCraw who oversaw the construction the actual shelter which opened it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doors in April of 2005. In 2008, Pet Pal built a low cost spay\/neuter clinic and in 2009, they expanded their services and changed the clinic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name to Pet Pal Veterinary Clinic. The Clinic offers reasonable fees for their procedures , therefore aiding the fight to cut down the large number of pets that are euthanized each year. Under the direction of Executive Director, Scott Daly, Pet Pal has stayed true to their mission and the number of animals that they save increases each year. It continues the fight to educate the public about the importance of spaying and neutering their pets and responsible pet ownership.","meetPets":"Pet Pal Animal Shelter is located at 405 22nd Street S., conveniently located in midtown St. Petersburg, just 4 blocks south of Central Avenue.\r\n","services":"adoptions","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Phone Check with applicant. Check references and Veterinarian reference. Home Visit. Sign Adoption Contract.

Mitzi came into my life at one of those moments where you realize God has bigger plans for you than you have for yourself. I had just began Veterinary Technology school, and one of the faculty members was looking to rehome Mitzi. Because she was a mix of two of my favorite breeds, Great Dane and Labrador Retriever, Mitzi came home to live with me as my first dog on my own.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nI quickly realized that the ideas I had in my head of snuggling with a dog in bed, going for nice walks, and socializing with other pets and their owners, was something that wouldn't be happening right away. Mitzi had clearly been abused and was fearful of many things. It took me years to successfully rehabilitate her, when other Pet Industry Professionals said she had no hope. She gradually learned to trust, love, and enjoy the life that every dog deserves to have. Mitzi taught me more than I taught her, she became my pride and joy.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nIn December of 2011, Mitzi was diagnosed with Oral Melanoma, deemed the worst form of cancer in companion animals. She was turned down by Cornell University twice, as patients with this form of cancer are typically unresponsive to any form of treatment and prognosis is documented as extremely poor. Mitzi and I disagreed, and so we traveled all across the U.S. looking for advice and a cure. We met many Oncologists, Surgeons, and Veterinarians, many of them helping to slow the cancerous growth down and buy us more time with our baby girl. Mitzi was so brave, she met every person willing to help her with a wagging tail and a relaxed personality.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nThe thought of losing her scared me more than anything. I saw her fight cancer the best that she could, she was so strong and determined to beat it that no one could tell her otherwise--and most tried to. She refused to give in, she refused to lose, she refused to leave behind the life that she struggled so hard to have from the start. The love we shared proved greater than the cancer in her body, and her medical specialists were amazed. Mitzi and I knew that cancer wouldn't easily break her down.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nOn October 15, 2012, I had to say goodbye to my best friend. The manner in which she left was peaceful and quiet. I thank God so much for blessing my life with her and bringing us together. She taught me how to love, trust, understand animals, laugh, enjoy life and to cherish every precious moment we had together. Not a day goes by that I don't think of her. My heart aches for the daughter that I lost, and I cannot wait until the moment when we can be reunited, together again, just like we were always meant to be.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nMitzi is no longer here on this earth with me physically, but she is in every memory, intuition, and thought that I have. She was a great sister to our ever-growing pet-family, and she continues to be the inspiration in my life throughout everything I do. This effort is for her, in her honor. I know she would be proud. Helping to rescue and rehabilitate other dogs who were just like her is a way to carry on her legacy, a way to give other people a chance at finding hope, love, and great friendship for years to come.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nAnd so, on December 4, 2012, Mitzi's Mission was born. All because we promised eachother,\r\n \r\n\"Forever & Always.\"\r\n","meetPets":" Adoptable Pets can be met at our Dog Daycare facility we also own, located at 1759 Sturgeon Point Rd, Derby, NY 14047.

","about":"Rescue Ridge is a highly recognized 501(c)(3) non-profit, no-kill animal rescue organization in Monmouth County, that has been steadily saving lives for over ten years.  Formed by the efforts of a local woman in 2001, Terri Willis committed her life to helping the animals of our community.  Born with a severe heart defect, Terri never allowed her disability to slow her down.  Her endless love, determination and dedication to all the animals was heartwarming and remarkable.  When she passed away, the animal community lost a great advocate and rescuer.  Although no longer with us, Terri\u00e2\u0080\u0099s undying spirit continues on through her dream\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. The dream of Rescue Ridge.\r\n\r\nStaffed entirely by volunteers, Rescue Ridge relies exclusively on donations, sponsorships and fundraisers for support, which goes back to the animals.  With the help of our many followers and volunteers, we primarily serve the Monmouth and Ocean Counties of the Jersey Shore, but have gone much further to rescue animals in need.  Known in our area as the \u00e2\u0080\u009clast chance\u00e2\u0080\u009d rescue, we have taken in many animals slated for euthanasia by shelters.  Animals come to us from all over the communities we serve for many different reasons.  We have helped animals whose owners could no longer care for them due to age, illness, behavioral or economic reasons, keeping them out of the overcrowded shelters and adopting them back into loving homes.  We have never turned away a stray or any animal in distress.  We have taken in \u00e2\u0080\u009cdifficult\u00e2\u0080\u009d dogs that most other rescues or shelters would not even consider.  We take the time to socialize them, work with them and ultimately make them adoptable.\r\n\r\nOur vision is to take our efforts to a new level.  Committed to saving the lives of our community pets, Rescue Ridge is dedicated to the goal of introducing a no-kill shelter to Monmouth County.  Beyond a shelter, this safe haven for animals will offer our community the help it needs to finally put an end to the senseless deaths and unnecessary loss of life that these animals face daily.  Our focus will include education and affordable medical care to pet owners, keeping their animals healthy, comfortable and in their homes where they belong.  Never should a family have to surrender their pet to a shelter because they cannot afford their medical treatment.  We will also extend microchipping to our fellow animal lovers, making sure lost pets find their way home and not behind the bars of a shelter, where they can quickly wear out their welcome waiting for their family to find them.  We would be a proactive leader in putting an end to animal overpopulation by offering a true low cost spay\/neuter clinic.  A TNR (Trap & Release) Program would also be offered for feral cats, which would help keep the cat overpopulation to a minimum.  Our adoption center would be a safe and happy place, where families can come meet their new best friend.  Beyond all of this, we will offer affordable training and animal socialization to our communities, which will in turn, reinforce public safety and ensure the safety of our beloved pets.  This safe haven will be run by staff and our dedicated, experienced volunteers, many of whom have been with us for over ten years.\r\nBeing tremendous animal lovers, we all share the same belief that we can and we will make a difference, one animal at a time.  We know that this is not an easy task ahead, but there are many people and groups that will whole-heartedly support our efforts in making this happen.

When they find an animal that they may be interested in meeting they will then complete an adoption application.  This will then start the process of a potential adoption. It does not \u00e2\u0080\u009cbind\u00e2\u0080\u009d an applicant to the specified animal that they complete the application for, it merely is a request to meet an available STAR animal.\r\n\r\nApplication Review- All Applications are thoroughly reviewed. If the applicant may be the right match for the animal, it will be forwarded to the foster caregiver for review.  If the foster caregiver feels that their foster animal would be a good fit for the potential adopter; he or she will contact the applicant to answer questions about the animal and make arrangements for a meet and greet.\r\nPlease understand that it is very important to find the right match for both the animal and the adopter.  An application that is not approved for a certain animal does not necessarily mean that the adopter would not make a great pet guardian; it merely means that the adoption may not have been the right match.\r\n\r\nApproval to go Forward with a Meet and Greet- Meet and greets are scheduled with the foster caregiver and the potential adopter.  These can be done at any convenient location for the foster caregiver.  Adoption events would be the preferred location, but often time they are done at the caregiver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home, the potential adopter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home, or an animal friendly business. \r\n\r\nHome Visit- If after the meet and greet, the animal is determined to be the right match for the adopter, the adoption will then be listed as \u00e2\u0080\u009cpending\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  A home visit will then be completed by a STAR volunteer.  This is a home visit to determine if the home is a safe place for the animal.  If a dog requires a fenced in yard, this will also be thoroughly checked at this time. \r\n\r\nFinalize Adoption- After the home visit is approved, the adoption can then be finalized.  There will be an adoption contract to fill out and the adoption fee to make payment for.  Arrangements can then be made with the foster caregiver to pick up the new family member!\r\n","about":"We are a new foster based animal rescue based in South Saint Paul, Minnesota.\r\n\r\nI have many years of volunteer experience with other local animal rescues as a foster and as the Director of the Cat Program.\r\n\r\nI started this new organization in November of 2014 to help more animals get rescued and find their forever homes.","meetPets":"Meet and greets can be set up with the individual fosters.","services":"adoptions, fostering, spay\/neuter","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

We do not have a physical shelter; therefore we operate primarily through our foster homes, online databases, and adoption events\/expos. Because we are a strictly in-home foster-based, no-kill organization, we heartbreakingly cannot take in every animal that needs assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur primary mission is to pull as many of our animals as possible from the open admission shelter in Bay County, Florida, where overcrowding and overpopulation leads to the euthanasia of a great number of animals every year. Our secondary mission is to help control the local animal population by encouraging responsible pet ownership through education with a particular emphasis on the need for spaying and neutering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are committed to providing the animals that come into CCLAR, Inc. with everything a beloved family pet would receive. Such things include: necessary veterinary care to include medical treatment, vaccinations, and sterilization, bellies full of nutritious food and clean water, and an environment where the foster pet is loved, nurtured, and cared for by our fosters in a way that will build a sound foundation for the foster pet to become an amazing lifelong companion once adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing a comprehensive adoption process that is designed to ensure that we have found the most suitable home for each animal on an individual basis, we place our animals in loving and responsible permanent homes. As part of this process we not only ensure that we have found the perfect adopter\/adoptee match, but that our adopters are well-educated about the responsibilities and costs associated with pet ownership. The unique needs of our foster animals are our priority above all else when vetting potential adopters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are determined to keep administrative expenses extremely low so that virtually every dollar taken in goes directly to the physical and emotional well-being of the animals. Our relationship with our foster animals does not end with their adoption contract. CCLAR, Inc. remains interested in and committed to the welfare of our foster pets and will always be an open door for our adopters. Through our tight-knit fostering process we develop strong bonds with our foster animals and love to follow their progress as they grow into their own with their permanent families.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are an organization born of a mutual love and passion for animals and the drive to take that love and put it into action in a way that reduces euthanasia rates and enriches the lives of the homeless pets of Bay County. We are healing hearts one paw at a time, until they all have a place to call home.\r\n","meetPets":"We will be holding events on a monthly basis so that the public  may interact with the adoptable animals.

Her goal is to care for sick, undernourished, unwanted animals and to find permanent homes for them. Providing proper care for animals has been an integral part of Heathre's lifestyle. At one point she showed Rottweilers. For many years she was a member of Intermountain Therapy Animals (ITA), an organization dedicated to enhancing quality of life through the human\/animal bond. For the past three years she has been a volunteer at South Utah Valley Animal Shelter, working to reunite owners and lost pets. In May 2014 she organized the annual Celebrate Your Pet Event, a fundraiser for the shelter and great fun for the community.\r\n\r\nEventually Heather became aware of another ongoing animal problem. Not all pets are reunited with their owners, nor should they be. Some animals have been abused or abandoned. There is no going back for them. They have no voice. They need an advocate. Now they have both with Utah Valley Animal Rescue. As Heather says, \"Animals have feelings. They can be hurt. They don,t deserve to be mistreated. They trust and depend on their owners. Animals are not meant to be thrown away\".\r\n\r\nUtah Valley Animal Rescue works closely with Best Friends Animal Society in Kanab, UT; South Utah Valley Animal Shelter; and area veterinarians to provide a safe place for unwell or traumatized cats and dogs to heal and recover until they can be placed in permanent homes with people who will take proper care of them. All animals are spayed or neutered, and vaccinated before they are adopted out to responsible owners.\r\n\r\nHeather's staff includes Blaine, her husband, and Sean Danner. All of them have made animal safety and health top priorities. Heather states, We love animals and want to help them.

Anne Deton, animal advocate, took over in 1968 and by 1975 PCHuS was incorporated as a non-profit.  Our shelter was built in 1992.  We continue to be dedicated to improve the lives of companion animals in our community and finding permanent and loving adoptive homes for the cats and dogs in our care. We provide a safe haven for animals in transition, serve as advocates for animals and their people, work to end animal overpopulation and educate the public about compassion and responsibility towards all animals. Our shelter is a No-Kill facility where all incoming animals are evaluated, medically treated and rehabilitated when needed and then placed up for adoption. \r\nI became the Executive Director in March of 2012. I bring with me 4 degrees including a Masters.  I have worked at multiple day veterinary practices, worked at the Kansas Humane Society, and still currently employed PRN at the Veterinary Emergency and Specialty Hospital in Wichita, KS.  I accepted this position as a way to help a larger amount of animals in need.  Since March 2012 I have increased adoptions from 189 annually to 374 in 2012. This year we are projected to save 400 animals.  I logged 25,000 miles on my vehicle with transports (moving animals to other rescues in other states). I have collaborations with rescues in MN, KS, CO, and IL. I network other animals in need as well. I do outreach programs to church groups, schools and clubs and I am a foster parent. Why I do what I do is wonderful question to ask.  I do this because it is what I was put here to do. It is my calling, it is what I am passionate about. I can not imagine doing anything else.  I have a story I always like to tell when I explain what I do what I do.  Seven years ago, 2007,  I was working at a day practice where a litter of kittens were dropped off.  All were adopted except one lone black kitten.  I decided that instead of this kitten spending the weekend alone, I would  take it home with me for the weekend. I can not express the life changing experience that happened that Saturday.  I fell in love with this kitten. Don't get me wrong, I have cared for animals since I was a child but something happened that evening that changed the course of what will ultimately be my life's mission.  This kitten, named Tecate, became my first foster failure.  I discovered that following morning that he was born only 3 blocks from where I lived. He was surrendered to a practice that was outside of the city I lived in.  I call this fate. Destiny brought me this cat, destiny told me to take this kitten home, and destiny showed me in this kitten what I was to do with the life, rescue. Since that faithful weekend, I have rescued almost 500 animals on my own.  I do not own a home, I do not have many earthly possessions, I just bought a new car last year for transporting purposes but I had a vehicle that I called \"Old Faithful\". That beauty had over 200,000 miles but it was paid for and still ran decent.  I have spend thousands of dollars on animals that were never going to be mine but I would spend every cent again  if that meant that animals found that forever home.  This year alone, I adopted a dying Rottweiler that  I rescued off the highway.  What I mean by adopted is that he was in our program but sadly had become infected with Canine Influenza while fighting for his life in a rural OK highway for weeks.  We are a small organization with limited funding but when he was dying at the local vet, I adopted him and took him to Wichita to the Veterinary Specialty Hospital to try to save him. Sadly after a week of endoscopies to clear out his lungs, spending the entire time in an oxygen chamber, he deteriorated.  That Friday when I went to KS to see how he was doing, he looked me in the eyes and told me to let him go. I did. I gave him that peace that he needed.  Even though he did not survive, I feel he felt the love  and compassion I gave him. He didn't die alone on the streets, he went peacefully with someone who cared for him.  The money I spent, the whole $2000, was worth it.  I gave him that chance and I showed him that there are good people out there.  My family, my friends, my colleagues know that I wouldn't be me if I didn't have a kitten at home that I was fostering, or networking 'til 2am to save a dog.  So back to the question: Why you do it?  Because it is what I was put on this Earth to do.  \r\n\r\n","meetPets":"We are open from 11-6 Wednesday to Friday and Saturday 10-2.

Our goal is to raise public awareness to the plight of animals and the beauty of adopting a homeless animal in need of forever loving care.\r\n\r\nWe carefully screen all of our potential adopters, allowing the best match possible between animal and adopter. All of our animals are spayed or neutered, fully vaccinated and medically treated. We do not discriminate based on breed, age or health status of the animal.\r\n\r\nOur animals come from shelters that frequently euthanize for space, from owners who can no longer care for them or when an owner is terminally ill and needs the peace of mind to know their beloved pet will be safe and loved. We also accept and place companion animals who are unwanted, neglected and released from puppy mills and need a second chance at a full and happy life.\r\n\r\nFinding Shelter was inspired by Sprout, a little, blind chihuahua who was found as a stray and was in great need of rescue. Founders Grace and Steve Herbert knew they had to do something to help the 3 pound dog who was found on the side of the road and taken to a county shelter. They took him in as a foster with plans to get to a point where he could find a forever family. But Sprout was very underweight, afraid and sick. After an initial visit to the vet, it seemed that Sprout\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future was looking grim. He had a gran mal seizure and it was suggested that Sprout be euthanized as he was expected to live only two weeks. In their hearts, Grace and Steve knew that the little dog with a healthy appetite had lots of fight in him. He needed a chance and they decided to give him one. So they started hospice care for Sprout and a miracle began to unfold. Sprout began to gain weight, learn commands, walk on a leash and even play. His personality began to shape and the smallest of milestones like drinking out of a water bowl, wagging his tail and playing with another family dog were celebrated. Sprout was adopted by Grace and Steve and had far surpassed the two weeks that he was expected to live.\r\n\r\nGrace and Steve were no strangers to animal rescue. Previously, Grace was the Executive Director of another no-kill animal shelter and all of their pets came from shelters or rescues. It seemed only fitting that the Herberts begin an animal rescue as a no-kill, safe haven for adoptable pets like Sprout who just needed a chance.\r\n\r\nOn February 1, 2012, Sprout lost his battle with hydrocephalus. He was and will continue to be our inspiration and we will continue to honor and celebrate his life.\r\n\r\nFinding Shelter provides the most loving care for the animals who need their help finding a permanent home. It is an organization based on love and respect for animals, supported by an incredible group of volunteers who work together to give these animals a quality life and the best chance for adoption.\r\n\r\n","meetPets":"We do not have a shelter so the first step is to submit an application at www.findingshelter.org. \r\n\r\nPlease check the event calendar at www.findingshelter.org to see where you can meet and greet our animals! \r\n\r\nNo on-site adoptions occur at our events.","services":"adoptions","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Our adoption counselors act as \u00e2\u0080\u009cmatch makers\u00e2\u0080\u009d and will work with you to find the right match for both you and the animal based on the information you give us.\r\n\r\nBased on the information you provide in your survey, we will introduce you to the animals we think will be a good fit.  If we do not find a match at your first visit, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t despair.  Sometimes it takes a few visits to find the perfect fit.  We will keep your survey on file for 2 months, but please call us if you see an animal on our website that appeals to you.  We cannot take special requests, so please check in with us frequently!\r\n\r\nIf you meet an animal that both you and the adoption counselor feels is a good match, you will be given an APPLICATION form to complete.\r\n\r\nWe ask for: (A) a personal reference (a friend, neighbor or other non-related person) that can attest to your ability to care for a pet; (B) if you rent or own a condo, we ask for your building information to make sure you are allowed to have cats or dogs on your property. This information can be in the form of a lease\/rental\/condo agreement (on company letterhead) or the phone number of a leasing office or landlord; (C) if you currently have a pet, or have had one within the last 10 years, we ask for your pet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vet care information.  Please provide all vet information that pertains to each animal you own(ed), i.e. Petco Clinic for annual vaccines, vet office ABC for routine care and\/or Specialist XYZ for sick visits.   It may be necessary to provide your vet(s) with permission to release your pets\u00e2\u0080\u0099 information to our adoption counselors.  Your doing this in advance will speed up the adoption process.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking to adopt a dog, we ask that all members of the household be present to meet the dog, or be able to come in to meet the dog at some point. This includes other dogs living in the household.  Not all dogs like each other and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better to find this out before you take your new dog home.  All dog-dog introductions will be done in the safety of the shelter with our staff present.  Expect this meeting to take 30-45 minutes.\r\nIf the dogs do not get along, do not interact with each other, ignore each other or otherwise seem unhappy with each other, we will not proceed with the adoption.  We want the process to be a happy one for every member of the family, 2-legged and 4!\r\n\r\nHow long does it take to adopt?\r\n\r\nCat applications can usually be processed within 2-4 days.  This time frame may be longer during peak adoption season (summer).  Dog applications may take a few days longer if we have to set up meetings with other family members or dogs.  Applications may be delayed if references do not return our calls or if multiple phone calls are needed.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good idea to let your landlord, personal reference and vet know to expect a call from us and, if we leave a message, please ask them to return it promptly, expediting the process.\r\n\r\nOnce I submit an application, am I guaranteed I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll adopt that animal?\r\n\r\nNo, we take more than one application per pet and submitting an application does not guarantee that you will be approved for adoption.\r\n\r\nAre there fees to adopt and what do I get for my money?\r\n\r\nYes, there are Adoption Fees:\r\n\r\n$100 per cat (over the age of 6 months)\r\n$175 per kitten \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Please call or email the shelter for information regarding our kitten adoptions. The process is slightly different.\r\nUp to $325 per dog \u00e2\u0080\u0093 We may sometimes require a training deposit to ensure that your new dog gets the training he\/she needs. The training deposit is $100 and is refundable upon proof of completion of a positive reinforcement training class.\r\nYour cat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adoption fee includes:\r\n\r\nSpay\/neuter surgery, rabies vaccine, distemper vaccine, FIV\/Felv testing, any medical treatment needed up to the date of the adoption, deworming, flea treatment, and a free starter bag of Science Diet pet food.\r\n\r\nYour dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adoption fee includes:\r\n\r\nSpay\/neuter surgery, rabies vaccine, distemper vaccine, Bordetella vaccine, heartworm testing, any medical treatment needed up to the date of the adoption, deworming, flea treatment and a free starter bag of Science Diet pet food.\r\nThe adoption fee may seem excessive to some people, but it only covers a fraction of the shelter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expenses related to caring for each animal.\r\n\r\nWhat will I receive when I adopt?\r\n\r\nWe will give you copies of the animal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s medical records and any other information pertaining to the animal.  We will give you food to start your pet off, a coupon for Science Diet brand pet food, and tips and helpful information on how to acclimate your new pet to your home and other animals.","about":"What Drives Us\r\nThe Epidemic of Unwanted Pets in the United States.  Millions of pets are euthanized each year because, quite simply, there are not enough homes for them. This unfortunate situation is referred to as \u00e2\u0080\u009cpet overpopulation\u00e2\u0080\u009d and there are numerous reasons for the problem including economic conditions, uninformed pet owners, and irresponsible and unintended pet breeding.\r\n\r\nWhat We Believe\r\nAt the Scituate Animal Shelter, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t euthanize for space or length of stay.

We have joined together in an effort to help homeless and displaced Anatolians find a new lease on life.\r\n\r\nNASRN works with owners who are no longer able to, or no longer wish to, keep their Anatolians, in placing them in more suitable homes. We cannot, however, place a dog for an owner who is asking a fee or selling their ASD.\r\n\r\nWe also work directly with shelters in pulling dogs from facilities and placing them either in foster care or directly into new homes.

Dogs in particular. But it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t until she adopted a Pit Bull puppy, thirteen years ago, that her affinity developed into something much stronger. \r\n\r\nAliceA pharmaceutical sales rep by profession, Lesley spent most of her time off volunteering with dog rescue organizations and animal shelters. She was struck by the harsh reality: The majority of the dogs in shelters were healthy, family friendly animals, but due to time and space limitations, many had just five days to be adopted before being euthanized. \r\n\r\nAn overachiever with a can-do-anything spirit, Lesley knew that she could do more for animals. So she mustered up the courage to leave the corporate world, and created her own dog rescue organization in Los Angeles, Wags and Walks. Her goal is to educate people about the types of dogs in the shelters and find those animals suitable, loving, fosters and adopters.\r\n\r\n392056_2754168612638_225414243_nToday, she visits shelters as far as 60 miles away on a daily basis. She gets to know the animals, takes pictures and video, and urgently networks to find the dogs homes before they run out of time. Lesley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts have been nationally recognized, even resulting in a $10,000 grant from DogTime Media. To date, she has helped save the lives of hundreds of deserving dogs who have brought endless happiness and companionship to their families.\r\n\r\nLesley recognizes that despite her best efforts, many thousands more face uncertain fates. She asks that you join her in committing to saving as many lives as possible. Get involved. Adopt, foster, or donate.

Then, one of our knowledgeable customer service representatives brings the adopter and animal together in one of our Get Acquainted Rooms. There they have a quiet, private space to get to know each other better. During the visit, the customer service representative may discuss the following: \r\n\r\npast experiences with animals and current animals in the home \r\nlifestyle, including work schedule and the kinds of activities they plan to do with their companion animal \r\nhousing situation - own or rent, size of yard, etc. \r\nIn order to make the best match possible for a family and home, we suggest potential adopters bring along all members of the household to meet the new companion animal and bring their current dog(s) to meet a potential dog. Adopters must also be 18 or older. ","about":"PHS\/SPCA, a private non-profit organization guided by the humane ethic, builds healthy relationships between people and animals. Each year thousands of animals pass through our doors. We provide a warm bed, nutritious food, veterinary care and a gentle touch for the lost, stray, unwanted and injured domestic and wild animals in our community.\r\n\r\nAs an ethical choice to provide safe sanctuary for every animal in need and since we are contracted with all cities in San Mateo County, we have no control over the number of incoming animals. Last year, we received more than 8,500 dogs, cats and other pet animals as well as thousands of sick, injured and orphaned wildlife. We accept all animals, and often provide a second chance to the neediest \u2013 those who would otherwise be turned away at so-called \u201cno kill\u201d agencies that accept only highly adoptable animals. Our record is outstanding. Since 2003, we have adopted 100% of healthy dogs and cats. Our definition of \u201chealthy\u201d is based on the State\u2019s definition: dogs and cats without medical or behavioral issues, fully weaned and social. It excludes obviously unhealthy animals (those with injuries and illnesses or those behaviorally scarred from past treatment and mistreatment) as well as unweaned kittens and feral cats.  Sadly, in some cases like the ones mentioned above, all we can provide is a painless ending when resources have been exhausted.  While we cannot save every treatable animal, we place every healthy animal into a new home. Staff, volunteers and supporters are equally proud of the fact that we make well, then adopt, between 100-150 treatable animals every month.\r\n\r\n\r\nEducational programs, outreach clinics, and partnerships with other organizations bring our services to the many animals who never set paw in our shelter. We hold a monthly support group for those grieving the loss of a loved companion, assist county residents who face the daunting task of finding pet-friendly rental housing, offer multiple levels of obedience classes, offer a speakers bureau, and investigate hundreds of cruelty calls. PHS\/SPCA is much more than a shelter. It's a place where dedicated professionals and volunteers share their passion, talent and commitment in service to the animals and people in the diverse communities that make up San Mateo County. We invite you to learn more about us.\r\n\r\nOur Challenge\r\nDecades ago, The Peninsula Humane Society & SPCA\u2019s biggest challenge was animal overpopulation. The number of incoming unwanted animals was staggering.  In the mid 1970s, we took in 45,000 dogs and cats annually.  Due to our work educating people (including schoolchildren) about the importance of spaying and neutering their pets and, equally important, making spay\/neuter affordable, we now see far fewer incoming animals; around 10,000 dogs and cats each of the last few years. To further drive down this number, we added a mobile spay\/neuter program; we bring our \u201csurgery suite on wheels\u201d into targeted neighborhoods and offer spay\/neuter surgeries for free!  We\u2019re addressing other challenges as well.   \r\n\r\nAnimal cruelty \u2013 We\u2019ve established a Humane Investigations Dept. We intervene when animals are mistreated and present cases to our District Attorney\u2019s Office for prosecution.\r\n\r\nSpecialty care for animals -- Many animals arrive perfectly healthy. Others, however, require extensive medical care or one-on-one work with our Behavior Department staff before they can be placed in a new home. Donations to our Hope Program fund this life-saving work.\r\n\r\n\r\nVisibility \u2013 since we choose to have donations directly benefit animals, we need to be creative in terms of getting our word out. Staff columns in local papers, an active mobile adoption program, several levels of obedience classes, this terrific website, school visits and summer camp, a Speakers Bureau, and an award-winning PSA airing on all network affiliates are among the many ways we expand our community profile.   \r\nFifty Years of Innovation\r\nFor more than 50 years, PHS\/SPCA has been a progressive, often-modeled leader. Our roots trace to a small association of animal advocates who found deplorable conditions at the local pounds and established the Society. Soon thereafter, this new organization contracted with San Mateo County to provide animal control services -- the first such relationship of its kind. In the 1970s, PHS\/SPCA became the first California humane society to have an on-site Spay\/Neuter Clinic, a wildlife rehabilitation center and \"get acquainted\" rooms for the public to meet and play with shelter animals as part of the adoption process. By the late 1970s, the Society began teaching the humane treatment of animals to schoolchildren. In the 1980s, the Society began a mobile adoption program, and in the early 1990s, PHS\/SPCA was among the first shelters to offer sheltering services for pets belonging to domestic abuse victims and a free animal behavior helpline for local pet owners. More recent innovations include a pet assisted therapy program which brings our volunteers and their pets to patients and residents in hospitals and other health care facilities, a department devoted to addressing animal cruelty and a mobile spay\/neuter program which provides free surgeries for residents in targeted neighborhoods.\r\n","meetPets":"Our shelter based in San Mateo CA, is open from 11 am to 7 pm, Monday through Friday. 11 am to 6 pm, Saturday and Sunday.","services":"adoptions, spay\/neuter, wildlife care center, education and animal behavior programs ...","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

The cat will make sure to provide you with a rodent free barn. It's a win\/win situation.\r\n\r\nAre you a literary giant like Hemingway or Steinbeck and can plead a case? We need grant writers!

We exist solely on donations and will rely primarily on fundraising to help animals in need.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to raise awareness of the ever growing plight of homeless animals in this country, both in shelters and those dumped on our streets. Way too many amazing animals are euthanized every single day simply because they are homeless.\r\n\r\nWe want to introduce these animals to the public and educate people that unwanted companion animals are not damaged goods or unworthy, but really can be great family pets. Because the abuse, neglect, cruelty and medical cases cost shelters the most money and are the most urgent, they are often the first animals euthanized.\r\n\r\nIt is our goal to focus on the rescue of these urgent animals and provide them immediately the routine, emergency or specialized medical care they need and deserve. We will go beyond just vet care and get these animals rehabilitated as needed using trainers and behaviorists to help overcome issues related to past trauma.\r\n\r\nIt is our belief that no injured or abused animal should lose its life simply due to lack of funds. We do not have our own shelter, and we will rely on volunteers, fosters and adopters to take the animals into their homes and provide them with proper care and nurturing.\r\n\r\nAll of our animals will be vaccinated, heartworm tested, micro-chipped and altered. All of our homes, foster or adopter, will be fully screened, including references and vet check, an interview with the applicant and a home visit to ensure the home is the right fit for the animal.\r\n\r\nOur outreach and education efforts will take place online via Facebook, web site and other social media as well as in person in the community via community events, school assemblies and any place people may lawfully gather to exchange information and learn.\r\n\r\nOur message is one teaching general animal care and welfare, population control through spay and neuter and disease control in the animal population via proper vaccinations.\r\n\r\n ","meetPets":"We are a foster based rescue.

These animals have had enough hardship in their lives--our goal is to place these wonderful pets into homes where they will be safe and loved forever.\r\n\r\nPetConnect requires an adoption fee for all rescues. This fee helps cover the medical, spay\/neuter, transport and foster expenses incurred in rescuing each animal (our expenses for these rescues almost always exceed our adoption fees). All PetConnect Rescue animals must be spayed or neutered to help stem the vast problem of overpopulation.\r\n\r\nAdoption Fees:\r\nDogs: $250\r\nCats: $125\r\n\r\nPuppies and kittens: Additional $100 deposit\r\n\r\nIt is medically advised to spay\/neuter puppies and kittens after six months of age. PetConnect requests a deposit of $100 for puppies and kittens which will be reimbursed with proof of spay\/neuter.\r\n\r\nPetConnect will provide discounts for senior pets.","about":"PetConnect Rescue was founded in 2005, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and has evolved into a vibrant animal rescue organization. Our mission is to save the lives of dogs and cats that have been abandoned and place them in loving and permanent homes. On a daily basis, we respond to email and phone pleas for help for dogs and cats imminently slated for euthanasia. We pull these animals into rescue from over extended local shelters as well as rural shelters from West Virginia to Georgia. PetConnect Rescue is non breed specific organization and we are committed to stepping forward whenever we can and wherever there is the greatest need.\r\n\r\nPetConnect Rescue arranges for medical services for our rescues, which can range from routine treatments such as vaccinations and blood tests to serious medical conditions such as broken bones and embedded collars. All animals that come thru PetConnect Rescue are spayed or neutered to help stem the terrible problem of pet overpopulation.\r\n\r\nThe rescues that come into our care are primarily placed in foster homes. (Some are boarded with reputable kennels or at vet practices as well). Our foster volunteers provide loving care and socialization for these animals while they await their forever homes. Thanks to donation drives we are able to pass on supplies to our foster families such as crates, food, collars, toys, bedding etc\u2026\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 2009, The Kyra Macy Foundation joined forces with PetConnect Rescue. As a result of their support we have been able to acquire a 5 acre property in Leesburg, VA which will serve as a sanctuary and wellness center for our rescues. The property is presently undergoing renovations and is expected to be ready to start receiving dogs and cats in the fall of 2010.\r\n\r\nThe core mission of PetConnect is to rescue abandoned animals and place them in safe, loving and permanent homes. Time and again, potential adopters tell us that they are willing to wait to adopt from us because of the comfort level they have in working with our organization. We do our utmost to take the nervousness, uncertainty and difficulty out of adopting a pet and support the adoption process every step of the way. The level of volunteerism in all of this is heartwarming. Because of the dedication and commitment of our volunteers we are able to find loving homes for all of these animals who otherwise would not have had a chance.\r\n\r\nFrom high kill shelters to foster homes to adoptive families, PetConnect Rescue handles every step of the rescue process.","meetPets":"At the pet's foster home, at a time convenient to both potential adopter and foster.","services":"Adoptions","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Since Feb 2012 we have found homes for over 2300 dogs (as of December, 2015).\r\n\r\nOur volunteers are compassionate, companion animal welfare advocates dedicated to contributing their time, skills, finances, and experience.  In turn, their dedication helps save the lives of the abandoned, abused, homeless, neglected, orphaned, rejected, stray, and surrendered dogs in Houston's animal control facilities.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to rescuing and re-homing these dogs regardless of their breed or circumstance. We are motivated by the dire need to educate the public about the effects of irresponsible breeding practices, while helping the community by alleviating overcrowding in area shelters.\r\n\r\nK-9 Angels Rescue Board Members and Volunteers are 100% VOLUNTEER and receive NO compensation.\r\n\r\nWe are not a shelter in the sense that we are not positioned to accept dogs from the public. We personally select our dogs from the greater Houston animal control facilities where all dogs are subject to destruction because their \"crime\" is not having a home.\r\n\r\nA dog selected into our rescue program remains in our care until adopted.  Only when we are able to secure the best match between dog and new caregiver(s) is the dog released from our program.\r\n\r\nWe believe in foster homes.  A foster home provides the dog with a loving, safe environment and allows for behavioral observation and training. When a foster family is not available our dogs are kenneled until transported to our Adoption Center on Saturday morning.","meetPets":"5533 Weslayan (next to Chuck E.

Be specific in your answers to give us the best possible picture of your home and family. A volunteer will review your application and get back to you within five days. Due to the high volume of adoption applications, we use email to communicate initially during the screening process. Please remember to check your email for our response, and if you do not receive a reply to your application within five days, please email us.\r\n\r\nSometimes we may have concerns regarding an application, and we reserve the right to deny an application if we feel there is a reason the home would not be appropriate for one of our Keeshond rescue dogs. If we will not be proceeding with your application, we will do our best to communicate this in a timely fashion. We receive many applications online each day, and we usually have several persons interested in a particular Keeshond rescue dog. We closely review each application, looking at the family's lifestyle, how much time they spend at home, yard size, current pets in the household, their previous pet history and their knowledge of dogs. We compare this to what we feel would be the best environment for the dog, considering his or her training and exercise needs, any medical needs, how the dog relates to children and other animals, etc. After considering each application, we choose the one that seems to be the best match for the dog. If your application is not chosen for the dog you are initially interested in, we suggest you visit our web site often, and email us if there is a different dog you think would be a good fit for your family.\r\n \r\n# A home visit is required for approval of an application and will be done prior to adoption. The volunteer visiting your home will check your fence and gates for security, and will make sure that there aren't any safety hazards or other concerns within the home. In addition, we want to make sure that each member of the household agrees to the adoption and that any current pets in the home are well cared for. Adoption fees range from $250 to $400 for a Keeshond dog.","about":"  The primary purpose of Southern California Keeshond Rescue, Inc. is to rescue homeless Keeshond dogs, provide the dogs with safe, temporary foster care, and find new permanent homes for them with responsible, qualified owners.

This was before i was educated on puppy mills\/dog brokers, etc.   My pom passed away at age 6 to a auto immune disease.   During his illness i began researching the \"breeder\" and discovered she was a dog broker for a ohio amish puppy mill.   I was inspired to raise awareness and get involved in rescue.  \r\nI began by networking senior poms in kill shelters all over the country with my friend Kit.  We would reach out to rescues and make them aware of dogs in need,  raise pledges to assist rescues with needed vetting, and arrange pull and transport assistance.  We started a page on Facebook named \"Saving Senior Poms, Inspired by Chance\" to assist with building supporters for our cause.   Chance was our first official save,  he was in a southern Ca shelter and saved from death row. \r\nWe had a lot of supporters but few rescues willing to step up and help the senior dogs so i decided i couldn't sit back and watch these dogs die!

I find them, I train them, rehabilitate them, get them exposure and get them adopted or transferred to another specialist if need be. \r\n\r\nI do it for so many reasons but mostly because I'd never wish such a lonesome life on any living thing, especially on spirits that were always meant to be free.

Once you have completed an application, we will contact you to talk about a specific dog  about whom you\u2019ve expressed interest. \r\n\r\nAfter you\u2019ve been approved, we arrange for you to meet the dog, either at an adoption event or in a one-on-one introduction. Often, you can go home with your new companion the same day, though for some dogs\u2014small puppies and special-needs animals\u2014we will schedule a home visit before finalizing the adoption. Or, you may FOSTER an animal with the intent to adopt to ensure a good fit for both of you.\r\nWe ask for donations to help us cover spay\/neutering, shots, medical treatment, food, and supplies.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat if the adoption doesn't work out?\r\n     We have a lifetime return policy on our dogs, however, we have the application process to help prevent such an issue, so it's very important that you are honest when answering the questions.  Not all dogs are compatible in all situations, so it's imperative that you are forthright in the application process so we can help find the right match.  However, be sure you are ready to make a full commitment to adopting a dog, whether a puppy or an adult.  A dog is not a novelty or a toy, so the prospect of adopting should be well-thought-out & the commitment should be taken seriously.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nADOPTION TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n    * We often have many applications for a certain animal.  Please be advised that we will not be letting each person who submits an application know how many others are interested, just keep in mind that there may be others interested so it is best to schedule your meet and greet as soon as possible.  Sometimes people who submit applications do not follow through or are not approved so we want all applications to be reviewed in order to make sure that we put all our effort into choosing the best home for our rescues.  This is why we do not stop accepting applications just because one person is interested in the dog.\r\n\r\n\r\n    * Just because your adoption application is approved, does not mean you have been approved to adopt the dog.  The purpose of the meet and greet which is scheduled once the application is approved is a chance for YOU to see if the dog would make a good fit and for US to decide if we feel the dog would make a good fit for your family.  Any representative at Barks of Love Animal Rescue and Placement Services has the right to decide to what family we adopt our dogs into.  It is not first come first serve, it is best family best serve.\r\n\r\n\r\n    * Additionally, if you are approved for adoption after the meet and greet, we can offer many different ways for you to take the pet including placing an adoption hold, fostering to adopt, or adopt via spay\/neuter contract (meaning you are agreeing to take the dog unaltered into your home under the condition that one of our representatives will be taking the dog to get fixed between the prescribed time period).\r\n\r\n\r\n    * Adoption holds are not offered until we meet you in person.\r\n\r\n\r\n    * So please when you are filling out an application don't rush to the store to buy dog supplies or tell your children about your new adopted dog because there is always a possibility that someone else may adopt before you or that you may not be considered the best fit for the particular dog after the meet and greet and\/or homecheck.\r\n\r\n\r\n    * All dogs are microchipped to us and you will be added as the alternative contact.  Our dogs are rescued by us for life.\r\n\r\n\r\n    * Also, any foster family working with Barks of Love Animal Rescue and Placement Services has priority in whatever dog they are fostering; that is if I let them know that someone is interested and approved to meet the dog, if the foster wishes to adopt they will be our first choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n    * These terms and conditions are set forth to not only protect our rescue and our dogs in ensuring that they go to the best home possible but also to protect your emotions and well-being.  We know that the possibility of adopting a dog is very exciting but it is important to follow the process and understand that the dog is not considered yours for adoption until an adoption contract has been signed. ","about":"*We are NOT a shelter, therefore, we do not have a central place where you can meet the dogs. All dogs are in foster care getting ready for their forever homes*\r\n\r\nBarks of Love Animal Rescue and Placement Services is a non-profit corporation staffed as a volunteer group, established in June 2008 originally as Second Chances Rescue by Ashley Greenspan. Our goal is to decrease the total number of animals being euthanized in animal shelters each year by finding new, permanent homes for them. Our animals come from a variety of circumstances.\r\n\r\nMost of them are rescued from \"Death Row\" at local shelters, while others are brought to us by their owners as an alternative to the shelter, and others are just found afraid and abandoned on the streets.\r\n\r\nWe do not yet have our own kennel facility, so all of the animals we take in live in \"foster homes\" or with their owners until they are adopted.\r\n\r\nBarks of Love Animal Rescue and Placement Services has no paid employees and does not receive funding from any government agency.\r\n\r\nWe are staffed entirely by volunteers and obtain funds solely from adoption fees, fund-raisers, and donations.\r\n\r\nIn order to ultimately reduce the number of unwanted animals killed each year, we feel it is important to educate prospective owners and the general public about pet overpopulation and enforce a very strict spay\/neuter policy for all our adopted pets.\r\n\r\nWe spay or neuter all animals before placement regardless of breed.\r\n\r\nAll dogs are then rehabilitated, loved and cared for, bathed, vaccinated, microchipped, have had a vet evaluation, and are free of internal and external parasites.\r\n\r\nWe are also looking for foster homes, please open your hearts and homes.\r\n\r\nAll adoption fees go 100% directly into rescuing and caring for our dogs.\r\n\r\n \r\nFAQS\r\n\r\nWhy we don't have a shelter or facility where you can come see the dogs:\r\n\r\nWe have a strong foster care program instead. Our goal is to get dogs out of shelters and into nurturing foster homes or permanent homes immediately. Dogs  experience many of the same emotions as humans, such as stress, loneliness and depression. So we try to avoid having to put a rescue animal right back into a kennel environment if we can.\r\n\r\nThe difference between us and the SPCA or Humane Society:\r\nThe main difference is physical: We are an independent organization that primarily operates out of volunteers' homes, without a facility. We rescue animals OUT of primarily municipal shelters (city- and county-funded shelters whose adoption rates are very low in comparison to the number of animals taken in). We work in partnership with these animal shelters to rescue adoptable dogs. Often a rescue group like ours is the only hope these particular shelter dogs  have for a new life.\r\n \r\nThere are also benefits to adopting a dog from an organization like Barks of Love:\r\n\r\n    * Since we visit a variety of animal shelters to rescue dogs, we can be on the lookout for the specific type of animal you are interested in.\r\n    * Most of our adoptable animals have been in foster care--in a regular home environment--so we have a good idea of how each of our animals will behave in the real world. For dogs, we usually know if a dog is housebroken, good with other dogs, good with cats, appropriate for children or not, energy\/activity level, and so forth. This makes it easier to match up our dogs with the right home, and easier for you to select the right one.\r\n    * Our dogs have already been vet-checked, vaccinated, dewormed, and spayed\/neutered before adoption. While no one can guarantee the long-term health of any animal, we do take the time and incur the expense to get basic healthcare and assessments done before our dogs go to permanent homes.\r\n    * When you adopt from us, your pet already has close to $300.00 of care invested in it before you take him\/her home! Of course, the tender-loving care they receive from their foster parents, as we prepare them for their new permanent homes, is priceless!","meetPets":"By making appointments after and application has been approved or at public adoption events.","services":"adoptions, volunteer, fostering, fundraising, help with rehoming, rescuing from shelters, legal help","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Well, they got the manager, who reluctantly led me into the back to see the dogs.  I had picked out 4 on my list.  I was told I could only see 2.  Well I got to visit with one dog in the play yard, and saw the other 3 from a distance.  I adopted all 4 of them on the spot.  I paid for them out of my own pocket.  They were all rehomed as soon as they were made healthy and happy again.  That was the beginning of my adoptions.  For 2 years I adopted those dogs that stole my heart, and I would find them homes.  I then started rescuing (adopting) pregnant dogs or mamas and litters.  I have successfully adopted out many litters.  I have files on all of them.  They still have my heart.  So, now I have some adult dogs that I have had awhile.  They deserve their own person, so I need exposure to help them get on with their lives.

Simply fill out our Volunteer Application and submit it.\r\n\r\nRead on to find out more about HOW YOU CAN HELP US.\r\n\r\n    FOSTER HOMES - We are currently in desperate need of foster homes as more and more Rotties find their way into shelters. Foster care consists of temporarily housing a Rottweiler while providing for its basic needs such as food, water, shelter. SSRR provides medical care of the Rottweilers in our program, and our foster homes' out of pocket expenses are limited. We prefer that our foster homes keep their foster dogs indoors during their stay. Doing so helps the Rottweiler adjust to the common household noises and smells it will experience in its new home, and it also helps to further determine the personality of the Rottweiler and what type of home situation that it would do best in. We encourage crating the foster dog when not being supervised. Foster families must take a Basic Dog Obedience course within 30 days of becoming a foster family. This will allow the foster dog to have good manners when they go to their \"forever home\"\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n    HOME CHECKS - We also need people to do home checks for us. A home visit is something that is required before an individual is allowed to adopt one of our Rottweilers. It consists of going to the home of a potential adopter, checking the dog\u0092s proposed living conditions, asking questions outlined on our home visit form, and basically ensuring that the home is ready and properly equipped to handle the challenges and rewards of adding a new dog to their home. The Home Checks are the eyes and ears of SSRR. Performing the Home Check is what allows SSRR to place dogs in safe and secure homes.\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n    TRANSPORT - Transport help is of great demand in SSRR. Since we do not limit adopters by making them choose only from the dogs that are in their state of residence, we often need to arrange transport for an adopted Rottweiler to go from one state to another. Our volunteers will fill various 'legs' of the transport as they relay the dog across our coverage area from its current location to its new or adoptive home. Most legs range in size from 50 to 100 miles. Before you take a road trip with your family Check with SSRR to see if you can help transport a dog to their \"Forever Home\"\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n    PUBLIC EDUCATION - Since our purpose is not only to save Rottweilers but to educate those around us about this breed, we often reserve booth space at local dog events. We are always in need of volunteers to sit at these booths to pass out promotional material and to talk to passersby about Rottweiler rescue, the importance of spaying and neutering, and Rottweilers in general.\r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n    ADMINISTRATIVE AREAS \u0096 There are other more administrative areas such as fundraising, advertising, secretarial services, correspondence, etc. where we often find ourselves lacking volunteers. If you can be of assistance in any of these areas we welcome you to volunteer to fill this niche.\r\n\r\nAnyone who truly loves this breed can and should be involved in rescue!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt only takes a small portion of your time, and the rewards of doing so measure far beyond compare. If you feel this is the type of organization you'd like to be involved with and you live in one of the states we cover, please fill out our Volunteer Application.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you live in a state outside of our current coverage area, there are many other rescues that will welcome your help.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.rottrescue.org\/national_list_rott_rescue.html\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSSRR is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization.

","about":"About OCDRT\r\n\r\nPersimmonAustralian Cattle Dogs have always found themselves in shelters, as many people do not do proper research on the breed before acquiring an ACD. The need to have a network for them in Ohio is great. While Ohio Cattle Dog Rescue Team may be a newly formed group (mid 2014), this team has many combined years working together in rescue. The Founders of OCDRT have been active in ACD Rescue since 2003, along with backgrounds in the veterinary fields, animal control fields, business ownership fields, military fields; all have been through the adoption process with other Rescues.\r\n\r\nOCDRT takes in ACDs primarily from shelters. Owner surrenders are considered on a case by case basis if we have room. If you want to surrender your ACD, please contact us; maybe we can assist you with keeping your ACD in its own home first. After OCDRT takes in an ACD, OCDRT then completes all the vetting, does evaluations, does necessary training and when the ACD is ready, offers them for adoption to approved homes. ACDs who find themselves in the shelter may be there for any number of reasons and most often it is through no fault of their own. This breed is not for everyone; they are very cute as puppies, but when they start to herd \/ mouth \/ bark \/ ignore their person to do what pleases them (sometimes they are simply deaf), many people become overwhelmed and give the puppy away or surrender them to a shelter. These behaviors are all normal ACD behaviors; however, most people do not want to deal with the intelligence that comes along with this sometimes stubborn breed that will take over a home if allowed.\r\n\r\nOur fosters are normally older pups or young adults. We are often asked if the adult will bond with its new family and our answer is always \u2018YES!\u2019 This breed is very loyal and will typically pick one person in the family to shadow, but will interact with all in the family. When you adopt an adult, you skip all the \u2018unknowns\u2019 that come with a puppy. The adult\u2019s size, color, looks and temperament are known; a puppy is a blank slate. Breeding and how the pup is raised\/socialized will determine what kind of adult that puppy will become. If you still think you want a puppy, please know we do not adopt our puppies out until they are 16 weeks of age so we can have them altered \/ vaccinated and start a very strong foundation in socialization and training.

I agree to take full responsibility in meeting all of its needs, including providing appropriate food, exercise, grooming and companionship. I will renew any required licenses annually. My new pet will reside in my home. Under no circumstances will this pet be housed outdoors, in a garage, shed or other building other than that which I live, and I will not give away or relinquish ownership of this pet without prior notification to PAS, Inc.\r\n\r\nI will not allow my pet to roam at large, and will abide by all City and State animal laws pertaining to my pet.\r\n\r\n2. Your new pet has received its vaccinations. Please check with your Veterinarian for regular and necessary veterinary visits and yearly vaccinations to guard against disease. The Parma Animal Shelter, Inc. will not be responsible for any of these fees.\r\n\r\n3. There is no guarantee that a healthy-appearing pet is not incubating an illness which may become obvious after you take it home. The Parma Animal Shelter suggests that you take your new pet to your Veterinarian. If within 10 days from the date of adoption a serious health problem is discovered, you may make arrangements to return the animal, along with the Veterinarian's documentation of the illness. You may not return the pet due to behavior or minor health problems. The Parma Animal Shelter, Inc. reserves the right to refuse the return of any animal.\r\n\r\n4. To assist the Parma Animal Shelter in acquiring PERMANENT HOMES for its animals and to prevent \"TRYING OUT\" an animal, the adoption fee is non-refundable. No monetary refunds will be given under any circumstances. Parma Animal Shelter Inc. makes no warranty with respect to the temperament of the pet and will not be held responsible for any damages should the pet act in an aggressive manner.\r\n\r\n5. Any animal adopted into a multiple pet household should be confined from the rest of the pets for at least 7-10 days This will allow time for any communicable illnesses to appear and be treated by your veterinarian without spreading to other pets.\r\n\r\n6. Anyone found in violation of this adoption agreement and who fails to correct the violation within 48 hours, shall forfeit the adopted animal to the Parma Animal Shelter Inc. and be subject to possible fines.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe form above is used for every adoption.\r\n\r\nThe adoption fee is $85 for dogs and cats with reduction in price on dogs and cats over 7 yrs old to $50.00.   Puppies under 6 months are $100.\r\n\r\nDOGS\r\n \r\nDogs get: 1 year rabies shot, distemper\/parvo shot, Bordetella vaccine,\r\nHeartworm test and 1st heartworm pill,  they are  also checked for worms.\r\nWe take them to the Vet of our choice for spay\/neuter.\r\n \r\nAdoption Fee for Cats and Kittens \u0096 updated 1\/30\/2013  KITTENS are combo tested and given FVRCP vaccines until 3 months old (3 weeks apart up to a total of 3 shots). A one-year rabies vaccine (and certificate), blacklighting\/lyme dip (for ringworm prevention), two Advantage Multi treatments and four Pyrantel dewormings are administered as well. Spay\/neuter (through a local Veterinarian) is done when the kitten is three pounds. No kitten can leave the shelter without being spayed or neutered.  CATS are the same as kittens with the exception of a total of two FVRCP vaccines.  No cat can leave the shelter without being spayed or neutered.\r\n \r\nWe do not adopt animals as gifts or surprises.  The entire household where the animal will live must be interviewed and adoption application submitted for consideration by the Warden and the adoption committee.  If more than one adoption application is submitted for any animal, the decision is based on what is believed to be the best home available -- NOT first come, first serve.  Animals must be held for 5 days to give the owners a chance to find them.  During this time we can accept applications for adoption in case the owner doesn't come in.  We cannot \"hold\" animals till a decision is made whether to submit an application.  If the animal to be adopted is a dog and there is already a second dog in the household, the adoption counselor will want them to bring their other animals in for an interaction at the shelter so their compatibility can be judged.  There are pamphlets available at the shelter and information on this web site that will inform and advise you in the care of the animal you are adopting.  The volunteers are also available to answer questions you may have prior to and following the adoption.  Our mission is to find loving PERMANENT homes for these animals left homeless through no fault of their own.  The experience of being in a shelter is traumatic and distressing when the animals first come in.  We try very hard to make them comfortable during their stay with us.  Please be sure you research your decision to adopt before you apply.  We do not want to traumatize any of our guests further by causing them to be returned after adoption.","about":"The Parma Animal Shelter is run by volunteers for the stray and abandoned animals of the City of Parma, OH.\r\n\r\n6260 State Road\r\nParma, OH 44134\r\ntelephone 440-885-8014\r\nMission\r\nTo reconcile lost pets with their owners and find good homes for stray animals brought in by the Parma Animal Warden.\r\nCompany Overview\r\nThe Parma Animal Shelter is run by volunteers for the stray and abandoned animals of the City of Parma.

If you have never owned a pet, this step is skipped.\r\nIf your veterinary reference(s) cannot verify the spay\/neuter and vaccination status of current or previous pets, processing of your application will be stopped until you can provide this information.\r\nApplicant Interview\r\nA volunteer from Grey Face Rescue will contact you via phone to get to know you better along with ask any questions they may have.\r\nMeet & Greet\r\nOur organization does not have a shelter where the dogs can be visited. Our dogs are in foster homes. We do NOT arrange meetings between interested individuals and our fosters until an applicant has been approved via this adoption process.\r\nOnce you have been approved, a volunteer (usually the foster) will contact you about scheduling a time for you to meet the dog(s) you are interested in. This meeting may occur at the foster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s residence or your home.\r\nJust because you are determined to be an approved adopter, you are NOT guaranteed a particular dog. For some dogs we receive many applications so we may allow multiple applicants to have a meeting with the dog before we choose the home that we feel will be the best fit for the dog. Also, if the volunteer involved in the meeting with you and the dog, does not feel you are a good fit for the dog, you may be denied adoption of that particular dog but you may be allowed to adopt another dog.\r\nAdoption\r\nIf you have decided upon a dog that you would like to adopt you are required to sign an adoption contract and to provide payment of the adoption donation fee and spay\/neuter deposit if necessary.  At that time you become the owner of the dog.\r\nWe will then provide a couple cups of the dog food they have currently been eating, Grey Face Adoption tag, all medical and vet documents, a copy of the contract, transition packet to help in the transition process, a letter from the dogs foster giving you a more in depth info on the dogs likes, dislikes, behaviors, etc. Also, fosters may include specific toys or blankets the dog has become fond of.\r\nWe have a two week refund period meaning if you decide the dog is not a good fit for your family and you return him\/her within the two week refund period we will return your adoption donation to you. The adoption fee will be deposited upon receipt and refunded only if the adopted dog is returned within the two week refund period (or any prior agreed upon extension of the refund period).\r\nIf at any time you are having issues with the dog, please email or call your contact person and inform us. A volunteer will be in touch with you asap.\r\nOptional Post Adoption Follow-Up Visit\r\nOur adoption contract contains a clause that allows one of our volunteers or a representative the ability to perform a follow-up visit. We may require such a visit if we feel that the terms of the adoption contract are not being met. Grey Face Rescue is committed to the life, health and well being of every dog we place for the remainder of that dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life.

We take special care to match the right home with the right dog, ensuring a lifetime of love for both the pet and the adopter. To ensure the best matches are made, we have a process that has been proven effective in determining the best homes for our animals. We strive to find the best homes possible for our dogs, as well as find the right dog for you and your lifestyle.\r\nStep 1 \u0096 Complete Adoption Application The first step in the adoption process is filling out the application on our website. This application will tell us about you and your lifestyle, your home environment and your experience with pet ownership. We cannot accommodate an introduction with one of our dogs without this first step being completed.\r\nStep 2 \u0096 Application Preliminary Review Our application review volunteers will initially screen your application to determine if all necessary information was provided. If not you will be contacted to either fill out another application or provide additional information. Please allow 24 \u0096 48 hours for a volunteer to get back to you. After submitting your application, be sure to add allbreedvt@gmail.com to your contacts or check your spam folder. Most of our communication is done via e-mail.\r\nStep 3 \u0096 Landlord Approval Verified If it is determined that you rent your home, your landlord will be contacted to make sure you have approval to have a dog in your home. We also ask about any breed or size limitations. If your landlord does not allow for a dog in your home, your application will be denied at this point in the process.\r\nStep 4 \u0096 Veterinary References Contacted Our volunteers will contact the veterinary reference(s) you provided to determine if all your current pets are spayed\/neutered and up to date on vaccinations. If you don\u0092t have any current pets, we will ask about the veterinary care that your previous pets received. If you have never owned a pet, this step is skipped. We are happy to make recommendations if you are looking for a veterinarian. If your veterinary reference(s) cannot verify the spay\/neuter and vaccination status of current or previous pets, processing of your application will be held until you can provide this information.\r\nStep 5 \u0096 Personal References Contacted Our volunteers will contact your personal references and ask them questions in regards to whether they consider you to be a responsible pet owner. This is the portion of the process that can take the most amount of time. It is helpful if you contact your references and ask them to return our calls in a timely manner. If our reference checking volunteers have any major concerns about adopting a dog to you, based on communication with your references, your application may be denied at this point in the process.\r\nStep 6 \u0096 Meeting between Approved Applicant & Available Dogs. Most of our dogs are currently boarding at a facility in South Burlington, however our organization is volunteer run. We do NOT arrange meetings between interested individuals and our dogs until an applicant has been approved via this adoption process. Once you have been approved, a volunteer will contact you about scheduling a time for you to meet the dog(s) you are interested in. Just because you are determined to be an approved adopter, you are NOT guaranteed a particular dog. All adoptions are first come, first served and we cannot \u0093hold\u0094 a dog based on interest alone. Our priority is placing dogs in loving homes. If you fall in love at the time of your meeting but are not ready to bring the dog home with you, a dog can be reserved for three days with a non-refundable deposit of $150. This deposit will be applied to the total adoption fee when the adoption is finalized.\r\nStep 7 \u0096 Finalizing The Adoption Once you have decided on the dog a volunteer will proceed with paperwork. This includes reviewing and signing an adoption agreement, vet services form, and transfer of all ownership and vetting that we have on the dog. Adoption fees must be paid by cash, money order, or bank check only. Please note, as we rescue the majority of our dogs from high-kill Southern shelters we do not know a lot about the dog\u0092s history, genetics, age, or behaviors. We are able to share information we gather based on what we learn of our dogs during their time with us and in foster homes and based on their wellness exams by veterinarians.\r\nStep 8 \u0096 Trip to the Vet It is recommended that you make an appointment with your vet as soon as possible after adopting a dog from our program. While every effort is made to provide the best possible care once these dogs come to us, we cannot guarantee their health. Although all of our dogs have had their basic vaccines and are dewormed monthly, some clinical signs of viruses do not show up prior to adoption. Additionally, if, at the time of adoption, your dog was not already spayed\/neutered, you would have been required to sign a spay\/neuter agreement. Our adoption contract requires all dogs to be spayed\/neutered within one month of adoption or when age appropriate. You are asked to notify us when and by who this surgery will be will be performed. Our volunteers will verify that the dog has been spayed\/neutered. If you fail to spay\/neuter, as outlined in the adoption contract you signed, our organization will take appropriate measures to take back the dog\r\nStep 9 \u0096 Optional Post Adoption Follow-up Visit Our adoption contract contains a clause that allows one of our volunteers or a representative the ability to perform a follow-up visit. We may require such a visit if we feel that the terms of the adoption contract are not being met. All Breed Rescue is committed to the life, health and well-being of every dog we place for the remainder of that dog\u0092s life. Should the adoption not work out or you need to rehome the dog, we require, by contract, that the dog be returned to us.performed. Our volunteers will verify that the dog has been spayed\/neutered.

We do require an application be submitted before discussing the Dobermans in our program or scheduling a meet and greet, we would like to have the opportunity to know the human(s) interested as well as we have an obligation to each of the rescued dogs to keep them safe. Recommendations are made based on your environment, lifestyle and the best match, which is why we truly do need the opportunity to get to know you before making a suggestion regarding a Doberman for your family.\r\n\r\nOur adoption process consists of an adoption application, we do verify employment, call for a history of care at your veterinarian, and speak with your two personal references provided. Once that checklist is complete a home visit is scheduled, then a determination is made and we will speak with you regarding the Dobermans in our program and those coming to help you find a match for your environment and lifestyle. We ask every potential adopter to complete a two or four-week trial period depending on the temperament of the dog, and we assist our families with acclimating their new addition into their home, offer training advice and more during the trial period. Once complete we verify both humans and Doberman are happy, not stressed and at this time finalize the adoption contract. FDR, Inc. does require each adopter to complete a minimum of one certificate group obedience class at a reputable, positive reinforcement trainer, we will assist you with finding one if you don't already have one.\r\n\r\nThank you for your interest in opening your heart and home to an FDR rescue.

(FDR) is a registered, incorporated Pennsylvania 501(c)3 non-profit, charitable organization whose primary mission is to give abandoned and surrendered Dobermans a second chance at finding a loving, safe and suitable forever home.\r\n\r\nOur organization also networks with several other rescues and shelters. We will always assist other organizations when possible.\r\n\r\nWe also educate potential adopters, as well as the general public, about the Doberman breed, Doberman myths, and the importance of spaying\/neutering, puppy mill awareness and the benefits of training and socialization. We do this in an attempt to decrease the amount of unwanted Dobermans.\r\n\r\nOur Dobermans come to us from shelters, other rescues, strays or are turned over to us by their owners who are no longer able or willing to care for them.\r\n\r\nPrior to placement, each Doberman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s temperament is evaluated, they are examined, micro-chipped, spayed\/neutered, vaccinated, tested for heartworm and Lyme, worms, and parasites, and von Willebrand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disease if an intact purebred. All dogs coming into our program are tested and treated if we discover any other additional health concerns, and begin their monthly heartworm and flea\/tick preventatives. All dogs are taught basic obedience and manners while in their foster home.\r\n\r\nEvery adoption application is background and reference checked and must consent to a home visit to obtain approval to adopt from FDR. We attempt to create the best match between Doberman and adoptive home based on our evaluations.\r\n\r\nOur contract requires yearly veterinarian visits, additional if an issue arises, a minimum of one certificate, group obedience class with a positive trainer, the dog must be housed indoors, no outdoor tie outs or dog coops allowed, and there must be shade available to the dog in their fenced in yard.\r\n\r\nWe follow up post adoption to make certain the dog and family are bonding, going to training and happy as a unit.\r\n\r\nThe Dobermans coming into the program here at FDR are family members, we will continue to watch them grow and blossom in their \u00e2\u0080\u009cFureverhome\u00e2\u0080\u009d and will always be here for the dog and the family should they ever need us.\r\n\r\nAfter having Dobermans most of our entire adult life (29 years), cross posting to help those in need find rescue, volunteering for rescue and long discussions between my husband and myself, we decided to take the leap and follow our hearts. Dobermans are our children, as we have none of the human variety. We have seen so much over the last few years, especially now with the assistance of Facebook and other social media sites and the internet, and the sharing of Dobermans in need of rescue, fostering, and adoption, the many wonderful groups and organizations that work so hard to help the one thing nearest and dearest to all of our hearts, the DOBERMAN PINSCHER. We do this as a labor of love, our way to give back to the breed who has given us so very much and enriched our lives...one Doberman at a time.","meetPets":"Adopt-A-Pet.com, RescueMe.org, PetFinder.com","services":"Adoptions, Accept: Owner Surrenders, Strays and Pull from Shelters","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

Two independent rescuers in St. Joseph, Missouri had been rescuing dogs from local shelters and owner surrenders for several years, and had grown a tremendous passion for saving lives, especially the bully breeds in need.\r\n\r\nDanielle Reno had been working hand in hand with several shelters in her local area, such as Atchison, Kansas City, St. Joseph, and Mission KS to save lives and work towards finding homes for pets in need of fur-ever homes, while Rachel Kovac was just a few miles away in the same city doing the same exact thing, as well as running several training programs for pets and humans (Prison Pup Program) and branching her rescue work out nation-wide.

The application requests information about your situation, what sort of dog you wish to adopt, including age and behavior. We welcome applications from potential adopters who are able to love a dog with special physical or behavioral needs. No one is asked to adopt a dog with issues they cannot handle.\r\n\r\nWhile we usually experience a steady flow of incoming Boston Terriers needing to be re-homed, we also have a steady flow of people and families seeking to adopt a Boston Terrier through AZBTR.  We file applications, more or less, in order of receipt.  As we anticipate new dogs coming into our rescue, we attempt to fulfill those applications.  This is not always the case, however.  Our goal is to match our dogs to the best suited homes based on the individual dog's needs.\r\n\r\nIf acquiring a dog is a time sensitive issue for you or your family, rescue may not be for you.  If you are willing to wait for the right rescue to come to you, you are an ideal candidate for AZBTR.  It could be days, weeks, or months before we find a Boston Terrier that we feel is a good match for you.  As our success rate proves, these precious dogs are well worth the wait. \r\n\r\nWe carefully screen potential adoptive families, including interviewing adopters, checking references, and visiting homes. We prefer that adoptive homes have fenced yards because we do not place dogs in situations where they will be chained out or allowed to run loose. During the home visit we look for potential hazards for the Boston that the adopter may not have considered.\r\n\r\nDuring the interview phase, we are very interested to know about other pets potential adopters have or have had. Have they ever lost a pet or had one euthanized? Why? Do they have a history of lifetime commitment to their pets? How long will the dog be left alone each day and in what circumstances? Their answers to these questions help us understand if they have a history of long term commitment to their pets and they think carefully of the pets' well being.\r\n\r\nWe want adopters to be happy with their adopted Boston, too, so we learn as much as we can about the dog's history and temperament: is he\/she good with children, other dogs, cats? Everyone needs to be happy as a result of the adoption process.\r\n\r\nWe are very careful about the placements we make. We do our best to match the right Boston with the right adoptive home, because we want this to be the dog's permanent home.\r\n\r\nAdopters sign a Placement Contract with us, agreeing among other things to return the dog to us if they are not able to keep it themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Adoption Fee is based on the age of the Boston, as follows:\r\nAge of Boston \t        Fee\r\nUp to 12 months \t$300\r\n1-3 years\t                $275\r\n4-8 years \t                $250\r\n9 years and older \t$150\r\n\r\nThe Adoption Fee includes the health and ID services mentioned above. Additional medical expenses may be passed on to the adopter, based on negotiations with the adopter. We are open to discussing a lower adoption fee for senior Bostons, for adoption of more than one dog, or for adopters willing to take on a dog with an ongoing health issue. This fee schedule is in effect for Bostons adopted after June 17, 2006.\r\n\r\n","about":"Arizona Boston Terrier Rescue, Inc. (AZBTR) is an Arizona non-profit corporation dedicated to the rescue and re-homing of unwanted Boston Terriers, education of owners on responsible dog ownership, and education of the public on the Boston Terrier breed.\r\n\r\nAZBTR began life as the Rescue Committee of the Valley of the Sun Boston Terrier Club, a club founded in 1974 by a group of Boston Terrier lovers and breeders. As responsible breeders they knew that, in addition to improving and protecting the breed, it was also their obligation to help individual Bostons that needed new homes.\r\n\r\nOver the years, more and more Bostons needed help, and the Rescue Committee's operations grew to the point that it made sense to form a separate Boston Terrier rescue with the exclusive goal of helping dogs that needed new homes. Arizona Boston Terrier Rescue, Inc. was born as a free-standing non-profit corporation in 2006.\r\n\r\nToday AZBTR takes in adoptable Boston Terriers from many situations. We provide for their medical and behavioral needs, then place them in loving, permanent homes. All of our rescued dogs live with families in foster homes in Arizona. We operate statewide and occasionally take in dogs from nearby states. We do not run a shelter that you can visit. All of the rescue's operations are carried out by volunteers, most of whom have families and full-time jobs. We are very busy!\r\n\r\nThe costs of the care we provide for Bostons adds up. We charge an adoption fee for each Boston, but it rarely covers all of the costs, even for a simple case. We close the gap with fundraising activities throughout the year and donations from Boston Terrier Lovers.\r\n\r\nAZBTR follows a code of ethics that requires us to operate in a lawful and responsible fashion. For example, we are committed to spay\/neuter every dog before placement in a new home.\r\n\r\nAZBTR is a proud member of the Coalition of All Breed Rescue of Arizona.

We help dogs of all breeds, nationalities, color and age.  We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit no-kill animal rescue organization dedicated to rescuing homeless dogs and ensuring that they are placed in loving, caring homes. Dogs are rescued both from the euthanasia list at animal shelters and from people who are no longer able to care for their animals. We rescue the dogs that no one else wants. Whether left to die in the local shelter or starving and homeless on the streets, we take them in, provide them with medical care, spay and neuter services, micro-chips, vaccinations and behavioral training. After careful screening of the potential new family, we attempt to adopt the dogs to the best home possible.\r\nWe Care for Canines.....One Dog and One Life at a Time! \r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nCaring for Canines was born from one girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love and compassion for animals and her desire to help change the plight of homeless dogs. At fourteen years of age, Sarah Duncan started rescuing dogs and in 1992, Caring for Canines was established. Later, in 2003, Caring for Canines became a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. Since then, the organization has continued to grow as family, friends, and other members of the community have joined the cause and because of this support, more dogs are saved each week and placed in loving homes. \r\n\r\nIn the past 20 years, Caring for Canines has rescued over 10,000 homeless dogs and given them a second chance at life. We hope to save even more in the next 20 years and with your help, we can make that happen.\r\n","meetPets":"As the dogs are in foster homes throughout the Phoenix area, we set up Meet and Greets according to where the specific dog is located. We are very flexible on setting up visit times and can do nights and weekends. Our main foster home is on 40th Street and Shea so we will do most adoptions at this location.

This county has no Animal Shelter and no Animal Control.  For 8+  years we have worked hard to encourage the County Mayor & Commissions to get an Animal Shelter in place.  Since there is no state mandate to do such a thing, the county officials will not take responsibility for the stray & unwanted animals, citing monetary reasons.  Our county does grant us $4,000 a year, but this amount is only 7% of our annual financial need.  \r\n\r\nSo every single unclaimed stray, abandoned (and there are many), and\/or injured animals relies on our very small group for life-saving assistance.  We are often over-whelmed in attempting to take in as many of these neglected animals as possible.  Generally, we take in approximately 250+\/- unwanted or injured or sickly animals each year.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have 45 volunteers\/members on our rolls, only a handful (3 or 4) can foster these animals in their homes.   Most of us also have full time jobs.  Although vet expenses for all these animals are covered through donations & grants, the foster parents cover the food & treat expenses.  Also, each foster transports their adoptable pets to our nearest local city (Clarksville, TN) every single Sunday (without fail) to Petsmart Adoption Events from 11 to 4.  This transport is a 60+ mile round-trip for each foster parent.  The cost of transporting the animals is also paid for by the foster parents.\r\n","meetPets":"Every Sunday\r\nPetsmart, Clarksville, Tn\r\n11 to 4\r\n","services":"Adoption of fully vetted dogs and cats","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

This application is available on our website www.LGARinc.org\/Adopt. Once the application is completed, the potential adopter will submit the application online.  LGAR volunteers monitor the incoming applications daily. Every foster dog available for adoption is reviewed by either Jody or Caren and the Adoption Coordinator. \r\nOnce a qualified applicant is identified, all references checked and the potential adopter is approved, the Adoption Coordinator will contact the foster parent and ask them to schedule a meet and greet with the applicant. Once you have scheduled a meet and greet, please let the Adoption Coordinator know the date and time of the meeting.\r\nThe rescue also requires that all family members of the potential adopter (including family dogs) must be present for the meet and greet, or final adoption. If your foster dog is meeting a resident dog, these meet and greets should take place at a neutral location (not the foster or potential adopter home) unless otherwise directed. The rescue requires a home visit to ensure the safety and compatibility of the foster dog to a new home. The Adoption Coordinator, in conjunction with the foster parent and the potential adopter, schedules these home visits. For example: to ensure a foster dog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compatibility with a resident cat, or other animals.  The volunteer who conducts the home visit must fill out the Home Visit Form and submit it to LGAR upon completion.\r\nAfter the meet and greet (and if the applicant is still interested in the dog), foster parents should make a recommendation to the rescue regarding the adoption immediately following.\r\nThe foster dog always stays with the foster parent until they hear from the rescue. Please remember that all adoptions must be approved by the rescue. Final approval of all adoptions is at the sole discretion of LGAR. Please do not make any promises during a meet and greet. You should always let the potential adopter know that the rescue makes the final decision.\r\nOnce the adoption is approved by the rescue, the adopter pays the adoption fee and, if the dog is not already altered, makes a spay\/neuter appointment, if necessary. Foster dogs cannot go to a potential adopter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home until the adoption is finalized by the rescue. Many times, the foster dog will stay with the foster parent until the spay\/neuter surgery date. In some situations, the rescue may agree to a \u00e2\u0080\u0099spay\/neuter deposit\u00e2\u0080\u0099, and allow the dog to go with the adopter and the new adopter will provide proof of the surgery to the rescue in return for their deposit. This is at the discretion of the rescue. \r\n\r\nTax-deductible adoption fees are as follows:\r\nPuppies (dogs under 1 year)\t$400\r\nDogs over 1 year and under 25 lbs \t$300\r\nDogs over 1 year and over 25lbs\t$250\r\nDogs over 7 years (Senior)\t$150\r\n","about":"Looking Glass Animal Rescue (\u00e2\u0080\u009cLGAR\u00e2\u0080\u009d) is a nonprofit volunteer-based animal welfare organization dedicated to rescuing dogs from high-kill shelters, hoarding situations, puppy mills, animal fighting rings and more.  While we welcome all animals in need, we specifically focus on animals that are often overlooked due to age, breed, special need or an illness or injury requiring immediate, often costly medical attention that shelters are unable to provide.  Without a rescue outlet, these animals would otherwise be euthanized due to their issues.\r\n\r\nHundreds of animals are euthanized every year due to overpopulation, irresponsibility and sadly, cost.  This is particularly true with animals who suffer medical ailments, many of which are treatable yet they are often deemed \u00e2\u0080\u009cunadoptable\u00e2\u0080\u009d and withheld from public view.   These animals in particular suffer the worst fate because they sit in pain and fear with no hope of ever being given a second chance at life.  Because of this, we have developed a special focus within our rescue to save as many of these animals that we can.  Veterinary expenses alone can range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars depending on the severity of the condition which is often unknown at the time of pull.  Yet, in spite of these costs, our mission for every animal we pull into our rescue is to provide the most advanced medical and pain management treatments possible in an effort to ensure the best possible outcomes for these previously neglected and broken animals.  \r\n  \r\nIn addition to treating their acute medical needs, every dog rescued will be spayed\/neutered, if they are not already, and vaccinated and microchipped as soon as possible in an effort to give them the best opportunity for a healthy, happy life.  When people do decide to foster an animal or adopt from us, they should expect the animal will remain well and not pass disease to their resident pets. \r\n\r\nLastly, for each animal that we place, we provide extensive education on how to transition the animal into their new life.  Basics like crate training, housetraining, obedience training, and the best ways to introduce resident pets are integral for the success of the relationship.  When necessary we will also engage professional trainers for those animals that need specific behavior modification in an effort to help our animals and their new family position themselves for success.  Mental health is as important as physical health and we believe that every animal should be given the chance to lead a life free of fear and anxiety.  Like psychologists, professional trainers are often the only ones equipped to transition an abused animal from the life that once \"was\" to the life that \"could be\".  Our goal is to ensure that all of our animals become a cherished and welcomed member of their new family for the remainder of their lives.\r\n\r\nBy working with a network of volunteer advocates, foster caregivers called Adoption Ambassadors, local veterinarians, trainers and shelters LGAR is hoping to be able to rescue hundreds of animals every year. We also serve as a resource to our community by providing information on pet ownership, including resources for spay\/neuter, positive behavior training, nutrition and veterinary care.

Most often you will need to drive to the area of the foster home, but if we can arrange transportation to you to meet the pup, we will do our best.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**We will discuss with you how the meet & greet went.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Once approved to adopt a particular pup, we will contact you with the news. You then have 24-48 hrs to discuss it with your family. You must then contact an NELR rep within this 24-48 hr timeframe if you do decide to adopt. This is very important as the details of arranging transport of the rescued dog will need to be made, often times we have several people involved in this process and we need to plan around multiple schedules. If we do not hear from you in this 24-48 hr time period, we will assume you have changed your mind, your application will be voided, and we will move on to other applicants.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**We will then work with you to either pick up your new pup, or arrange transportation to get the pup to you.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n** Lastly, you will sign our adoption contract and the adoption fee will be required upon your taking ownership of the pup.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThings to Remember:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Our goal is to find the best match based on the Lab\u0092s background and the family\u0092s needs. The temperament and energy level of the dog are our most important consideration. We consider factors in the home, including the ages of the children, ages of pets in the home and what type of other pets are in your home. We never base our adoption process on who gets their application in first, instead we weigh all applications to find the best suited family for the pup's needs based on our assessments of our dogs. Our number one goal is to be 100% committed to every dog we rescue.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**If you apply for a certain dog, we will do our best to see if that particular pup is a good fit, but there are times when, for many different reasons, that it might not be a good match. That does not mean there is anything wrong with your application, just that that particular dog requires different needs. Should you not be applying for a specific dog, the Adoption Coordinator will talk with you about which dogs best fit your home and lifestyle.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Please understand that although filling out an application is the first step in the process, filling out the application in and of itself does not guarantee that you will be able to adopt a particular pup...again many different factors go into our decisions, and our number one goal is to find the best suited family for that dog, with the goal being that none of our rescue dogs ever find themselves homeless again. Also please do not fill out an application and share with your children that you are adopting that particular dog, as it is not a guarantee until you receive confirmation from the Adoption Coordinator that you are approved to adopt a particular rescued dog. NELR does reserve the right to deny any application for any reason.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**At the time of adoption, we will provide you with copies of the Lab\u0092s medical history and any information from the previous owner if available.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**The adoption donation for a Rescue Lab is $350. For Labs under the age of 1 year, the Adoption donation is $375. For seniors over 7 yrs of age there is a reduced adoption donation of between $100-$200. Full payment is required at the time of adoption. This is an all volunteer organization, so all adoption fees and donations go right back into rescuing more labs in urgent need!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Families with children 10 years old or younger must have a fenced-in area.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**We do not place Labs in families with children unless we know the dog has a positive\r\n\r\n experience with children.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**We do not place Rescue Labs with families that run a home-based childcare or doggie\r\n\r\n daycare program.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**All current dogs in an applicant's home must be up-to-date on all vaccines, including the Bordetella vaccine (kennel cough.) They also must be treated monthly with Heartgard or a similar heartworm preventative.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Finally please understand that all of us put many hours into helping NELR each week, but we are all volunteers, with our own families, jobs, our own dogs, often times foster dogs, etc...We work very hard at saving these beautiful labs, but we can't always make everyone happy with our placement choices. If a dog you were interested in is ultimately placed with a different adoptive family, please do not take it personally. Again it does not mean that there was anything wrong with your application, more that it wasn't the right placement for the dog. We always have other beautiful labs available for adoption, which we will be happy to discuss with you and might be just perfect for your family.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPost Adoption\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**First and Foremost, please remember that all rescue pups need to be given a period of time to adjust to their new home, bond with their new family, and possibly relearn some manners. They may have already proven to be successful with house training for example, but once again are in a new place and are now confused & possibly scared until they settle in. They don\u0092t arrive at a new home knowing which door they should use to go out, who to alert to, etc...they need to be trained with the new house rules and to learn what is and isn\u0092t allowed. These pups have been through a lot, and need lots of love, consistency and set boundaries. Some rescue pups walk into their new homes and it is like they have always been there, others may take a few weeks to a few months to really settle in.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**Volunteers will be available to help you with problems and concerns, and to answer\r\n\r\n any questions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**If, for any reason, the adoption is not satisfactory, the Lab must be returned to NELR as stated in the Adoption Agreement.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n**New England Lab Rescue reserves the right to take possession of a Rescue Lab that is\r\n\r\n neglected, improperly cared for, develops a serious temperament problem, or is allowed to run loose.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank You for Considering New England Lab Rescue.","about":"New England Lab Rescue was founded in 2010 by Heather Labbe'. When she saw the number of Labs showing up in shelters steadily increase, Heather decided to step up and make a difference.\r\n\r\nNew England is a region of the country with a high demand for Labrador Retrievers, resulting in very few found in local shelters. Heather realized that with funding and a lot of hard work, she could rescue animals from shelters in southern states and bring them to New England for adoption.\r\n\r\nTo date, NELR has helped over 200 Labs find their fur-ever families.\r\n\r\nNELR expects to have 501c3 status in 2011 and hopes to see an increase in funding at that time, which means more Labs can be rescued!\r\n\r\nIf you cannot adopt or foster a Lab but would like to help us with our efforts, please contact us to find out how you can get involved!\r\n","meetPets":"We try to schedule meet and greets once applicants are approved, but locations do not always match up","services":"Adoptions","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

We found a wonderful place for him to work called Woodland West Animal Hospital. They allowed him to work through vocational training and he got to work with the animals!

He got students involved in volunteering and helping local animal rescues. That was only the beginning for Spencer.\r\n\r\n He got involved with the Oklahoma Alliance for Animals in Tulsa, Oklahoma. They took him under their wings and he flourished again. He got involved in adoption events, helping animals that had been affected by wildfires and tornadoes.

We rescue just a handful of dogs at a time, rehabilitate them as necessary, and find their new forever homes. Our focus is on puggles, pit bull-type dogs, and boxers.\r\n\r\nSaving Lives\u2026\r\n\r\nWhen we started, we were rescuing puggles from small shelters based in the Midwest  as very few puggles were making their way into the shelters in San Diego and Los Angeles. In the 5+ years we\u2019ve been involved with rescue this has changed dramatically and we can now only accept puggles from local shelters.\r\n\r\nOccasionally we accept puggles from owners who are no longer able to take care of them. Please contact us directly if you are looking for a rescue to whom you can surrender your puggle.  If you would like assistance in rehoming your puggle but can keep the dog in the meantime, we can help with that process. Please contact us at pugglesnpitties@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nWe only rescue pitties from shelters located Southern CA because we must be able to evaluate them directly before committing to them. We do not accept owner-surrender pit bulls, as there are too many at risk of dying in the shelters.\r\n\r\n\u2026Rehabilitating Souls.\r\n\r\nSome dogs come to us with physical ailments that need to be treated or fixed. Those are the easy things to do, they just take money. Fix a broken leg, repair a cherry eye, treat demodectic mange\u2026if we have the money, we won\u2019t shy away from a dog with any physical injuries.\r\n\r\nWhere the real work comes in is with rehabilitating the dogs\u2019 hearts and souls.  Whether we\u2019ve gotten them from an animal shelter or directly from an owner, these dogs have no idea how they\u2019ve ended up where they are and why they\u2019re suddenly with us.  They don\u2019t understand getting lost and picked up by animal control, never to be reclaimed by their mom or dad. They don\u2019t understand divorce or financial hardship or allergies. Dogs are loyal until the end, and they don\u2019t understand any of the reasons humans come up with for giving away their beloved family member.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, these dogs are lost, confused, sad, lonely, depressed, scared, uncertain\u2026any adjective you want to put on someone who has just lost their home for reasons they can\u2019t comprehend. In addition, some of these dogs need additional training. Whatever the reason given for getting rid of a dog, usually the real reason is that the dog has never been trained and has no doggie manners. If they\u2019re no longer a cute puppy, people don\u2019t often want to put up with their antics. So we use positive reinforcement training in order to teach them the basics of good dog behavior.\r\n\r\nSome dogs come to us very insecure. We don\u2019t pretend to know why; inadequate socialization as puppies, sheltered lives as adults, abusive owners\u2026the list of possible explanations is endless really. These dogs go through basic obedience training; intensive socialization with the other dogs in the rescue and in the foster home; gradual introduction to their new outside environment through regular walks and other exercise; plus confidence-building through specialized, FUN training and activities. We really work hard to overcome whatever deficits they come to us with so they can go on to live healthy, happy, confident lives in their forever home.\r\n\r\nTeaching dogs how to be dogs \u2013 well-behaved, confident, happy dogs \u2013 is what we mean when we say we \u201crehabilitate souls.\u201d It\u2019s one of the most rewarding parts of what we do.","meetPets":"By appointment only.","services":"Rescue dogs from shelters and place them into forever homes.","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

A dog, singular.  What I found was shocking!  LOTS and lots of perfect family pets in need of homes, some stuck in high kill shelters that would be euthanized.  I panicked and quickly adopted 4 dogs...... ya, nuts!  They were all perfect and I kept finding more.  In an effort to not become a crazy dog lady, I started fostering for rescue groups but would still pick up strays and find them homes.  Eventually after learning from fostering for several great rescues in the area, I decided I could do this too!  I absolutely LOVE rescue and love finding adopters their perfect match!

We very much encourage fostering an animal first before actually adopting. Please ask us about our fostering procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdoptions are held at the shelter, 11901 S.

","about":"The Amarillo SPCA is a 501(c)3 non profit organization. We operate solely on donations and fundraisers.\r\n\r\nWe operate a shelter for dogs and cats and have approximately 140 animals, most of which are housed at the shelter.  A few live temporarily in foster homes.\r\n\r\nOne of our main concerns as an organization is pet over population. It is important that the public be educated about the importance of spaying and neutering their pets. It is also our goal to make sure every animal that is adopted from the SPCA is sterilized before going to a new home.\r\n\r\nWe receive calls daily from people who request help with their animals--either needing to give them up or asking for help with food and medical needs. We help whenever we can.  Our kennels are full most of the time but we will try our hardest to accommodate any animal that is homeless or needing a home.  Because of our own expenses, we rarely are able to help the public with pet care costs. We do provide spay and neuter vouchers for a significantly reduced fee. We also provide microchipping services to the general public for a reduced fee.\r\n\r\nWe have grown to the extent that volunteers alone cannot provide necessary hours for operating the kennels. We have a shelter manager and part time employees along with volunteers who work hard maintaining the shelter.\r\n\r\nMany animals we bring into the shelter need immediate medical care, and all animals that come to us receive their shots, a microchip and sterilization before being adopted into their new homes. Frequently these expenses are far more than the adoption fee of $100. It is our duty to provide the best medical treatment possible regardless of cost for our animals--and therefore our vet bills are always very large.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have created this website to provide accessible information concerning all of the animal related organizations and events that are occuring in the Texas Panhandle as well as a resource base for those seeking advice or care for their pets.\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, we invite anyone who is affiliated with a particular animal welfare organization, specialized pet-owner group (such as pet therapy or obedience training,) or any business that is in the service of animals (veterinarians, groomers, pet sitters, etc.) to contact us so that we may tell the public about your organization or business. We do, however, respectfully decline to list any breeders or to promote breeding services as it is not in alignment with our mission of curbing the pet overpopulation crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Amarillo SPCA","meetPets":"Dogs and cats are available for adoption at our shelter Tuesday through Saturday, 12-5 p.m..

She fell quickly into the matriarchal role in our pack of pups at home.  She was always by your side and happy to follow you around the house wagging her tail.  She was one of the most loyal dogs I ever had the privilege to live with.  She reminded me of my childhood dog, a black lab named Bianca.\r\n\r\nIn August of 2012 I came home to work over lunch to find her being a bit lazy but wagging her tail nonetheless.  In a few short but whirlwind hours she went from acting a bit ill to passing away at the vets office from an apparent unidentified tumor.  At the age of 7 or 8 years old, she left us way too soon!  After trying to settle into life without her in the pack of now 5 pups, we soon realized that her spot in the pack needed to be filled.  There was no doubt that it needed to be filled by another rescue.  After weeks of searching online I found a 4-5 month old puppy who appeared to be about the same breed and looked like an angel!  We started the adoption process and within a few weeks were wrapped up in a world of rescues, shelters and transports.  We made the 10+ hour drive to the shelter where she was being cared for in Bamberg, SC where we met an amazing man named Bob who devotes his time to helping the helpless.  The shelter was a ram shackled place with about 40 dogs who had been abandoned or lost.  Each and every one touched our hearts and we wished we could take them all home.   While we were there to get her we helped to rescue two abandoned puppies from a culvert under the road.  It was then that we knew that we had found our calling!\r\n\r\nUpon her arrival at her furever home\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 she was greeted by the other dogs with lots of sniffs and settled in quickly as the missing member of the pack.  She fit like a glove!  On our first walk that first night she led me by leash to our front yard and made a b-line to the tree where we had too recently buried our precious Vega.  She walked slowly to her gravesite and bowed her head and  \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhisper-barked\u00e2\u0080\u009d and walked back toward the house.  As if to say \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is okay, I will take care of them\u00e2\u0080\u009d!  After spending an hour crying in disbelief, I knew she was exactly what we needed\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 and we were exactly what she needed!\r\n\r\nFrom that moment on we have been dedicated to do our best to not allow any other of \u00e2\u0080\u009cman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u009d to go without all that they deserve!

Dachshund Rescue of Houston is a 501(c)(3) corporation supported strictly through donor contributions. Our volunteers include law, accountancy and taxation experts, who make sure that all funds are utilized in accordance with the laws and regulations required to be in full compliance with our tax exempt status. All donations are deductible to the full extent of this law. \r\n\r\n Because we have no paid staff or facilities, every dime of your donation goes strictly to the care and vetting of our dachshunds. The events held to raise funds and awareness are self supporting through the generosity of sponsors and donors. \r\n\r\nWe are a small group of doxie lovers that all happen to call Houston \"Home\". We love the dachshund breed and can't bear to think of any dachshunds suffering.","meetPets":"People can view all adoptable pets online, and can visit them at one of the many adoption awareness events that we throw throughout the year.

Since 1999 the Quincy Animal Shelter has placed more than 3,600 cats and dogs into loving and forever homes through out MA and New England.\r\n\r\nAs a \"no kill\" shelter, we make every effort to find the right home for every animal in our care. This means we exercise the same ethical and humane treatment of animals in our facility that you would for your own family's feline or canine friend. Every animal receives age-appropriate vaccinations and, if old enough, is spayed or neutered before finding its forever family. \r\n\r\nDelivering this type of care involves many volunteers, an active and dedicated management, and a lot of money. Our budget runs approximately $100,000 every year in order to keep doing what we do to help the dogs and cats of Quincy. \r\n\r\nPlease visit our Volunteer and Wish List pages to find out about ways you can help. Our capacity at the Shelter is limited to a maximum of 12 dogs and 15 to 25 cats, depending on ages and condition of the cats.

A volunteer will begin processing the application which consists of: verifying information, completing a vet reference, checking personal references, and lastly a home visit to be approved.\r\nCommon Questions:\r\nHow long does it take?\r\nApplications take on average 1-2 weeks to complete. Please remember we are all volunteers. A great way to speed this up is to let your references know they will be receiving a call from us, one of the number one reasons applications get slowed down is waiting on return calls from your references. You may also want to let your vet know we are calling as some won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t release information without your consent.

Dogs that are young (under 3, and especially puppies), female, very small (under 15 lbs), etc usually have a lot of interest. If the dog you are looking for fits any of those characteristics, we recommend getting on the approved list now.

A whopping three puppies had been adopted. We set up outside Church Ranch Vet Wellness Center in Westminster. It's a long way to go since we live in Aurora and had to shuttle ourselves, playpens and puppies all the way up there. There were three directors and about 10 foster homes when we started. The only volunteers were family members bribed with food.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, four years later, we still have three directors, but we also have a volunteer coordinator and a foster coordinator. We have over 30 foster families and over 40 active volunteers. Colorado Puppy Rescue averages 20 adoptions a week and we have set up inside Petco at Colorado Blvd and I-25. It's a lot closer to home and we get to keep all of our crates and pens there.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am very proud of all that we have accomplished over the last four years. Thank you very much to our adopters, volunteers and fosters; without whom this would never have been possible. Since the beginning our CPR community has helped to rescue and find homes for over 4000 puppies. We value our volunteers and adopters tremendously; we could not run the rescue without them!

In fact, each person in the U.S would have to take 8-9 dogs or cats per person for all of the homeless pets to be adopted.  To decrease the number of pets euthanized each year it is important to educate people about the importance of spaying and neutering our pets.  Also, with the help of volunteers and donations, we can help to arrange low cost spay and neuter programs, thus providing these services to those who could not otherwise afford them. Through education and spay\/neuter programs we can help to combat the problem of over population.  It is the national goal within animal rescue organizations that this will be a no kill nation by 2015.  We will strive to do our part with your help.\r\n\r\nFor those dogs already in distress, our goal is to rescue homeless and surrendered dogs.  With the support of donations and the hard work of volunteers, we can rescue and rehabilitate dogs in need. We will provide shelter, veterinary care, love, toys, food, and training for those who are in need. In addition, we work to find forever homes for each dog and, once adopted, we support the adoptive owners so the adjustment process is successful and the new family member is a permanent member.\r\n\r\nFinally, pitbull breeds are in grave distress: of all dogs in shelters, 70-75% are pit bulls or pit bull mixes. Only 1 in 600 dogs of this breed will find a home and the remainder are euthanized. Due to the pervasive negative publicity surrounding this breed, there is a reluctance to allow one to become a family member. Yet in the past, this breed was the most popular in the country; the immortalized as the marine mascot; and was affectionately known as \"the nanny dog\". Through the work of dedicated animal groups such as Bestfriends Animal Society, BAD RAP and many others, this amazing breed is being given a chance to correct the negative reputation they have been unjustly branded with.  Remember: a dog's behavior is a reflection of the personality traits of his or her owner and not the reverse.","meetPets":"By appointment or at the weekends we have our dogs at the local Petsmart.","services":"We rescue, adopt and help with low cost spay and neuter events.","allowAppSubmissions":"No","messageOrg":"Yes"}

","about":"This is an all volunteer 501c3 organization dedicated to the improvement of the lives of our best friends. \r\n\r\nCurrently millions of pets are euthanized every year due to over population. In fact, each person in the U.S would have to take 8-9 dogs or cats per person for all of the homeless pets to be adopted.  It is the national goal within animal rescue organizations that this will be a no kill nation by 2015.  To achieve this goal, we require all of our dogs to be spayed or neutered before adoption.  Also we provide education regarding the importance of spaying and neutering our pets.  A veterinarian we work with will be assisting us in providing low cost spay and neuter programs, thus providing these services to those who could not otherwise afford them.\r\n\r\nFor those dogs already in distress, our goal is to rescue homeless and surrendered dogs.  With the support of donations and the hard work of volunteers, we can rescue and rehabilitate dogs in need. We will provide shelter, veterinary care, love, toys, food, and training. In addition, we work to find forever homes for each dog and, once adopted, we support the adoptive owners so the adjustment process is successful and the new family member is a permanent member.\r\n\r\nFinally, pitbull breeds are in grave distress: of all dogs in shelters, 70-75% are \"pit bulls or pit bull mixes\". Only 1 in 600 dogs of this breed will find a home and the remainder are euthanized. Due to the pervasive negative publicity surrounding this breed, there is a reluctance to allow one to become a family member.  Yet as a \"pitbull\" owners, we strongly believe this stereotype is false.  As an organization, we are working daily thru our actions and the actions of the dogs in the rescue to prove that the breed is being unfairly demonized and deserves to be judged on an individual basis as a dog regardless of pedigree and physical appearance.","meetPets":"Please call for appointment.

CCS is a nonprofit organization and was established in order to improve the quality of life for homeless, injured and abused cats in the Denver metropolitan area. The Society's goals are:\r\n\r\nTo sponsor educational programs that promote responsible pet ownership, humane treatment of all animals, and the elimination of pet overpopulation;\r\nTo shelter cats in a healthy, cage free environment and to find compatible and responsible families for every cat;\r\nTo provide community outreach programs that improve the quality of life for cats and people;\r\nTo be a friend to all cats.\r\n\r\nThe shelter provides a temporary refuge for more than 50 cats until an appropriate and permanent home can be found for each. Veterinary care, premium diet and human interaction are lovingly provided.\r\n\r\nThe large number of phone calls received each day from people who have found abandoned, abused or injured cats needing good homes indicates a strong community need for our services.  We receive an average of 70 phone calls for assistance daily.  Sadly, more than half of these are from owners needing to give up their cats.  For these cats, we provide Information about placing the cat and referrals to other area shelters.   We also provide this same information to people who have found a cat when we are at or over our capacity and cannot take the cat.  Many calls involve behavioral problems or are questions about feral (wild) cats.  Behavior counseling and printed articles on a wide variety of topics are available at the shelter.  \r\n\r\nCat Care Society is supported by a number of loyal members and contributors, without whom we could not operate. We receive no government funding. In addition, our volunteers assist with many fundraising activities each year such as our Tails of the Painted Cats Gala Dinner & Auction, Meow Mart, Paws On The Green Charity Golf Tournament, Santa Paws Festival, Colorado Gives Day, and much more. \r\n\r\nWe offer these these programs for our donors:\r\n\r\nNine Lives Legacy Society\r\nNine Lives Cat Guardianship Program\r\nNine Lives Partners Giving Club\r\n\r\nCCS respects the privacy of our donors.
